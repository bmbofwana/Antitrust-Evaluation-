III. Applicability
A. This Final Judgment applies to Defendants, as defined above, and all other persons in active concert or participation with Defendants who receive actual notice of this Final Judgment by personal service or otherwise.
B. If, prior to complying with Section IV and V of this Final Judgment, Defendants sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets that include the Divestiture Assets, they shall require, as a condition of the sale or other disposition, that the purchaser agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Final Judgment. Defendants need not obtain such an agreement from the Acquirer of the assets divested pursuant to this Final Judgment.
IV. Divestitures
A. Defendants are ordered and directed, within 120 calendar days after the filing of the Complaint in this matter, or five (5) days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to divest the Divestiture Assets in a manner consistent with this Final Judgment to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion. The United States, in its sole discretion, may agree to one or more extensions of this time period not to exceed sixty (60) days in total, and shall notify the Court in such circumstances. Defendants agree to use their best efforts to divest the Divestiture Assets as expeditiously as possible.
B. In accomplishing the divestitures ordered by the Final Judgment, Defendants promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of the Divestiture Assets. Defendants shall inform any person making inquiry regarding a possible purchase of the Divestiture Assets that they are being divested pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide that person with a copy of this Final Judgment. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, Defendants shall offer to furnish to all prospective Acquirers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information and documents relating to the Divestiture Assets that customarily are provided in a due diligence process except such information or documents subject to the attorney-client or work-product privilege. Defendants shall make available such information to the United States at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
C. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, Defendants shall provide the Acquirer and the United States information relating to personnel involved in production, operations, and sales at the Divestiture Assets to enable the Acquirer to make offers of employment. Defendants will not interfere with any negotiations by the Acquirer to employ any employee of the Divestiture Assets whose primary responsibility is production, operations, or sales at the Divestiture Assets.
D. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, Defendants shall permit prospective Acquirers of the Divestiture Assets to have reasonable access to personnel and to make inspections of the physical facilities of the Divestiture Assets; access to any and all environmental, zoning, and other permit documents and information; and access to any and all financial, operational, and other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.
E. Defendants shall warrant to the Acquirer of the Divestiture Assets that each asset will be operational on the date of sale.
F. Defendants shall not take any action that will impede in any way the permitting, operation, or divestiture of the Divestiture Assets.
G. At the option of the Acquirer, Defendants shall enter into a fiber supply contract for old newsprint (ONP) sufficient to meet 25% of the Acquirer's needs for a period of up to three (3) years from the date of the divestiture. The terms and conditions of any such contract must be reasonably related to market conditions for old newsprint and the purchase price shall be set at the prevailing market price.
H. At the option of the purchaser and upon approval by the United States, in its sole discretion, Defendants may enter into a transition services agreement based upon commercial terms and conditions. Such an agreement may not exceed twelve (12) months from the date of the Divestiture. Transition services may include information technology support, information technology licensing, computer operations and data processing support, logistics support, and such other services as are reasonably necessary to operate the Divestiture Assets.
I. For the period from the date of the filing of the Complaint in this matter until one (1) year after the sale of the Divestiture Assets, Defendants shall make available and deliver to the Divestiture Assets within seven (7) business days the spare ceramic center roll from Abitibi's Thorold, Ontario newsprint mill if: (a) the Acquirer or the person identified in Section V(K), whomever is in control of the Divestiture Assets at the time, determines that the Divestiture Assets' PM 3 machine requires a new ceramic center roll and (b) the Divestiture Assets' permanent spare ceramic center roll, which has already been ordered, has not been delivered. If Defendants become obligated to deliver the spare ceramic center roll, then they may identify a suitable alternative ceramic center roll and request permission from the United States, in its sole discretion, to deliver the alternative center roll to the Divestiture Assets in place of the Thorold center roll. Such permission must be in writing. In any event, Defendants must deliver the Thorold center roll or an approved substitute to the Divestiture Assets within seven (7) business days of being notified of the need for the Thorold roll. Defendants will no longer be obligated to provide a ceramic center roll to the Divestiture Assets if either of the ceramic center rolls in Thorold's PM 6 or PM 7 machines break before the Divestiture Assets require a new ceramic center roll.
J. Defendants shall warrant to the Acquirer that there are no material defects in the environmental, zoning, or other permits pertaining to the operation of the Divestiture Assets, and that following the sale of the Divestiture Assets, Defendants will not undertake, directly or indirectly, any challenges to the environmental, zoning, or other permits relating to the operation of the Divestiture Assets.
K. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, any divestiture pursuant to Section IV, or by trustee appointed pursuant to Section V, of this Final Judgment, shall include the entire Divestiture Assets, and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that the Divestiture Assets can and will be used by the Acquirer as a viable, ongoing business engaged in producing, distributing, and selling newsprint, that the Divestiture Assets will remain viable, and that the divestiture of such asset will remedy the competitive harm alleged in the Complaint. The divestitures, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V of this Final Judgment,
shall be made to an Acquirer that, in the United States' sole judgment, has the intent and capability (including the necessary managerial, operational, technical, and financial capability)to compete effectively in the production, distribution, and sale of newsprint; and
shall be accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that none of the terms of any agreement between Acquirer and Defendants gives Defendants the ability to unreasonably raise the Acquirer's costs, to lower the Acquirer's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the Acquirer to compete effectively in the production, distribution, and sale of newsprint.
V. Appointment of Trustee to Effect Divestitures
A. If Defendants have not divested the Divestiture Assets within the time period specified in Section IV(A), Defendants shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestiture of the Divestiture Assets.
B. After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the Divestiture Assets. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, and VI of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court deems appropriate. Subject to paragraph V(D) of this Final Judgment, the trustee may hire at the cost and expense of Defendants any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents, who shall be solely accountable to the trustee, reasonably necessary in the trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture.
C. Defendants shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objection by Defendants must be conveyed in writing to the United States and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VI.
D. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of Defendants, on such terms and conditions as the United States approves, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the Divestiture Assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to Defendants and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of the trustee and any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the Divestiture Assets and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished, but timeliness is paramount.
E. Defendants shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the business to be divested, and Defendants shall develop financial and other information relevant to such business as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to reasonable protection for trade secrets or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture.
F. After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the United States and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestiture ordered under this Final Judgment. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the Divestiture Assets.
G. If the trustee has not accomplished such divestiture within six (6) months after its appointment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth: (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture; (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestiture has not been accomplished; and (3) the trustee's recommendations. To the extent such report contains information that the trustee deems confidential, such report shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the United States, who shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VI. Notice of Proposed Divestiture
A. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, Defendants or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture required herein, shall notify the United States of any proposed divestiture required by Section IV or V of this Final Judgment. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify Defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestiture and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered or expressed an interest in or desire to acquire any ownership interest in the Divestiture Assets, together with full details of the same.
B. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the United States of such notice, the United States may request from Defendants, the proposed Acquirer, any other third party, or the trustee, if applicable, additional information concerning the proposed divestiture, the proposed Acquirer, and any other potential Acquirer. Defendants and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
C. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice, or within twenty (20) calendar days after the United States has been provided the additional information requested from Defendants, the proposed Acquirer, any third party, or the trustee, whichever is later, the United States shall provide written notice to Defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States provides written notice that it does not object, the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to Defendants' limited right to object to the sale under Section V(C) of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed Acquirer or upon objection by the United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or Section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by Defendants under paragraph V(C), a divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VII. Asset Preservation
Until the divestiture required by this Final Judgment has been accomplished, Defendants shall take all steps necessary to comply with the Asset Preservation Stipulation and Order entered by this Court. Defendants shall take no action that would jeopardize the divestiture ordered by this Court.
VIII. Affidavits
A. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, and every thirty (30) calendar days thereafter until the divestitures have been completed under Section IV or V, Defendants shall deliver to the United States an affidavit as to the fact and manner of its compliance with Section IV or V of this Final Judgment. Each such affidavit shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding thirty days, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts Defendants have taken to solicit buyers for the Divestiture Assets, and to provide required information to any prospective Acquirer, including the limitations, if any, on such information. Assuming the information set forth in the affidavit is true and complete, any objection by the United States to information provided by Defendants, including limitations on the information, shall be made within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such affidavit.
B. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, Defendants shall deliver to the United States an affidavit that describes in reasonable detail all actions Defendants have taken and all steps they have implemented on an ongoing basis to comply with Section VII of this Final Judgment. Defendants shall deliver to the United States an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in Defendants' earlier affidavits filed pursuant to this section within fifteen (15) calendar days after the change is implemented.
C. Defendants shall keep all records of all efforts made to preserve and divest the Divestiture Assets until one year after such divestiture has been completed.
IX. Compliance Inspection
A. For the purposes of determining or securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or of determining whether the Final Judgment should be modified or vacated, and subject to any legally recognized privilege, from time to time duly authorized representatives of the United States Department of Justice, including consultants and other persons retained by the United States, shall, upon written request of a duly authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, and on reasonable notice to Defendants, be permitted:
access during Defendants' office hours to inspect and copy, or at the United States's option, to require Defendants to provide electronic or hard copies of, all books, ledgers, accounts, records, data, and documents in the possession, custody, or control of Defendants, relating to any matters contained in this Final Judgment; and
to interview, either informally or on the record, Defendants' officers, employees, or agents, who may have their individual counsel present, regarding such matters. The interviews shall be subject to the reasonable convenience of the interviewee and without restraint or interference by Defendants.
B. Upon the written request of a duly authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, Defendants shall submit written reports or responses to written interrogatories, under oath if requested, relating to any of the matters contained in this Final Judgment as may be requested.
C. No information or documents obtained by the means provided in this section shall be divulged by the United States to any person other than an authorized representative of the executive branch of the United States, except in the course of legal proceedings to which the United States is a party (including grand jury proceedings), or for the purpose of securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or as otherwise required by law.
D. If, at the time information or documents are furnished by Defendants to the United States, Defendants represent and identify in writing the material in any such information or documents to which a claim of protection may be asserted under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Defendants mark each pertinent page of such material, ""Subject to claim of protection under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,"" then the United States shall give Defendants ten (10) calendar days notice prior to divulging such material in any legal proceeding (other than a grand jury proceeding).
X. Notification of Future Transactions
A. Unless such transaction is otherwise subject to the reporting and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18a (the ""HSR Act""), Defendants shall not, without notifying the United States, directly or indirectly acquire any assets or any interest, including any financial, security, loan, equity, or management interest, in any of Defendants' jointly-owned newsprint mills or machines if the value of such acquisition exceeds $2,000,000. Defendants are exempted from this notice provision if either (1) from the date of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, the acquisition accounts for less than a 5% change in any interest and does not change control in any of Defendants' jointly-owned mills or machines, or (2) the acquisition is the direct result of an asset swap between one of Defendants' jointly-owned mills or machines to another of Defendants' mills or machines of the same character, and (3) such transaction is not otherwise subject to the requirements of the HSR Act. This notification requirement shall run for a period of ten (10) years from the entry of this Final Judgment.
Provided, however, that the following transactions shall be exempt from the notice requirement: (1) Defendants further investing in a pre-existing jointly-owned mill or machine on a pro-rata basis with Defendants' partner(s); and (2) loans (including guarantees and security interests on loans) for the following purposes, provided that they do not enable any distribution from the joint venture to Defendants or Defendants' joint venture partner(s) that would not have otherwise occurred: (i) capital expenditures relating to pre-existing jointly-owned mills or machines, (ii) working capital transactions of the same character that Defendants have engaged in over the past ten (10) years; (iii) debt repayment or refinancing which does not impact equity share or the relative effective return between Defendants and their partner(s); and (iv) mergers or acquisitions other than those relating to newsprint mills or machines.
B. Such notification shall be provided to the United States in the same format as, and per the instructions relating to, the Notification and Report Form set forth in the Appendix to Part 803 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations as amended, except that the information requested in Items 5 through 9 of the instructions must be provided only about newsprint, and the required filing fee under the HSR Act shall be waived. Notification shall be provided at least thirty (30) days prior to acquiring any such assets or interest, and shall include, beyond what may be required by the applicable instructions, the names of the principal representatives of the parties to the agreement who negotiated the agreement, and any management or strategic plans discussing the proposed transaction.

AND WHEREAS, defendants have agreed to be bound by the provisions of this Revised Final Judgment pending its approval by the Court;
AND WHEREAS, plaintiffs intend to preserve competition by requiring Aetna to divest its interests in the Houston operations of NYLCare Health Plans of the Gulf Coast, Inc. and the Dallas operations of NYLCare Health Plans of the Southwest, Inc., consisting of, among other assets, approximately two hundred sixty thousand (260,000) and one hundred sixty seven thousand (167,000) commercially insured HMO and HMO-based POS enrollees, respectively;
AND WHEREAS, plaintiffs require defendants to make the divestitures for the purpose of establishing a viable competitor in the development, marketing, and sale of HMO and HMO-based POS health plans in the Houston and Dallas areas;
AND WHEREAS, plaintiffs require defendants to make the divestitures for the purpose of redressing the effects that the United States and the State of Texas allege would otherwise result from Aetna's proposed acquisition of Prudential's health care assets, including the ability to depress physicians' reimbursement rates in Houston and Dallas, which is likely to lead to a reduction in quantity or a degradation in the quality of physician services provided to patients in those areas;

Aetna shall use its best efforts to accomplish the divestitures as expeditiously as possible and will accelerate the timetable for executing the definitive purchase and sale agreement(s) for the divestiture of the NYLCare entities to a target date of October 1, 1999. In any event, Aetna shall execute definitive purchase and sale agreement(s) and shall file all required applications for regulatory approval within one-hundred and twenty (120) calendar days after June 21, 1999. Aetna shall complete the divestitures within five (5) business days after it receives all necessary regulatory approvals for divestiture of NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest and the acquisition of Prudential, or five (5) business days after notice of the entry of this Revised Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later.
The plaintiffs, in their sole discretion, subject to Section XII, may extend the time period for any divestitures for an additional period of time not to exceed sixty (60) calendar days. If a further extension is required to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, the plaintiffs, in their sole discretion, subject to Section XII, may grant the time necessary to obtain such approvals.
In accomplishing the divestitures ordered by this Revised Final Judgment, Aetna promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability for purchase of NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest. Aetna shall inform any person making an inquiry regarding a possible purchase that the sale is being made pursuant to this Revised Final Judgment and shall provide such person with a copy of this Revised Final Judgment. Aetna shall also offer to furnish to all prospective purchasers, subject to reasonable confidentiality assurances, all information regarding NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest customarily provided in a due diligence process, except information subject to the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work-product privilege. Aetna shall make available such non-privileged information to the United States and the State of Texas at the same time that such information is made available to prospective purchasers.

Aetna will appoint experienced senior management to run the combined business of NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest. These executives may be recruited from within the existing Aetna or NYLCare organizations, with plaintiffs' approval, subject to Section XII, or from outside the company.
Aetna will create a separate and independent sales organization for NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest.
Aetna will create a separate and independent provider relations organization for NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest.

Aetna will create a separate and independent commercial operations organization for the combined NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest.
Aetna will create a separate and independent network operations organization for the combined NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest.
Aetna will create a separate and independent underwriting organization for the combined NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest.
Pursuant to transition services agreements approved by plaintiffs, subject to Section XII, Aetna will provide certain support services to NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest. These services may include human resources, legal, finance, actuarial, software and computer operations support, and other services which are now provided to NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest by other Aetna companies. These transition services agreements will contain appropriate confidentiality provisions to ensure that Aetna employees (other than the employees performing services under the agreements) do not receive information that Aetna is prohibited from receiving under Section III.E of the Revised Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered earlier.
Aetna will provide any additional transitional services requested by the management of NYLCare-Gulf Coast and/or NYLCare-Southwest in order to maintain the membership targets described in Section IV.B. Such additional services may include, but not be limited to, funding of service quality guarantees, subject to the approval of the plaintiffs in their sole discretion, pursuant to Section XII.
Aetna will fund an incentive pool of at least $500,000, which will be available to management of the NYLCare entities if they meet the membership targets described in Section IV.B as of the closing date for the sale of the NYLCare entities.
Aetna shall not take any action to consummate the proposed acquisition of Prudential's health care business pursuant to the Asset Transfer and Acquisition Agreement, dated as of December 9, 1998, or any subsequent agreement between Aetna and Prudential, until such time as plaintiffs, to their sole satisfaction, subject to Section XII, have determined that NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest are independent, viable competitors, that Aetna has complied with the terms of the Revised Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered previously, or until the divestitures required by this Revised Final Judgment are complete.
Aetna shall request that the NYLCare entities provide the plaintiffs with bi-weekly reports on total membership of the entities until the divestitures required by this Revised Final Judgment are complete.
Unless the plaintiffs, in their sole discretion, subject to Section XII, consent in writing, the divestitures pursuant to Section IV (or by trustee appointed pursuant to Section V) shall include the entire NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest businesses, excepting only the Excluded Assets, operated pursuant to the Revised Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered previously in this proceeding, and shall be accomplished by selling or otherwise conveying NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest to a purchaser(s) in such a way as to satisfy the plaintiffs in their sole discretion, subject to Section XII, that NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest can and will be used by the purchaser(s) as part of a viable, ongoing business engaged in the sale of HMO and HMO-based POS plans. These divestitures may be made to one or more purchasers provided that in each instance it is demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of the plaintiffs, subject to Section XII, that the acquirer(s) will remain viable competitors. The divestitures, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V, shall be made to a purchaser(s) for whom it is demonstrated to the plaintiffs' sole satisfaction, subject to Section XII: (1) has the capability and intent of competing effectively in the sale of HMO and HMO-based POS plans in Dallas and Houston; (2) has the managerial, operational, and financial capability to compete effectively in the sale of HMO and HMO-based POS plans in Houston and Dallas; and (3) is not restrained through any agreement with Aetna or otherwise in its ability to compete effectively in the sale of HMO and HMO-based POS plans in Dallas and Houston.
For a period of one year from the date of the completion of the divestiture, Aetna shall not hire or solicit to hire any individual who, on the date of the divestiture, was an employee of NYLCare-Gulf Coast or NYLCare-Southwest, unless such individual has (1) a written offer of employment from a third party for a like position, or (2) a written notice from the acquirer of NYLCare-Gulf Coast or NYLCare-Southwest, stating that the company does not intend to continue to employ the individual in a like position.
V. APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE
In the event that Aetna has not divested NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest within the time specified in Section IV, the Court shall appoint, on application of the plaintiffs, a trustee selected by the plaintiffs in their sole discretion, subject to Section XII, to effect the required divestitures.
After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest, as described in Sections II.E and II.F. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestitures at the best price then obtainable upon a reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV and VI, and shall have such other powers as the Court shall deem appropriate. Subject to Section V.C, the trustee shall have the power and authority to hire, at the cost and expense of Aetna, any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents reasonably necessary in the judgment of the trustee to assist in the divestitures, and such professionals and agents shall be accountable solely to the trustee. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestitures at the earliest possible time to a purchaser acceptable to the plaintiffs in their sole discretion, subject to Section XII; shall have the power and authority to require Aetna to sell NYLCare's PPO business in Houston and Dallas if the plaintiffs, in the exercise of their sole discretion, subject to Section XII, determine that such a sale is necessary for the preservation of competition; and shall have such other power and authority as this Court shall deem appropriate. Aetna shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any grounds other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by Aetna must be conveyed in writing to the plaintiffs and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VI.
The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of Aetna, on such terms and conditions as the Court may prescribe, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to Aetna and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of such trustee and of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the divested business and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestitures and the speed with which they are accomplished.
Aetna shall use its best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestitures, including best efforts to effect all necessary regulatory approvals. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the businesses to be divested, and Aetna shall develop financial or other information relevant to the business to be divested customarily provided in a due diligence process as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to customary confidentiality assurances. Aetna shall permit prospective purchasers of NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest to have reasonable access to personnel and to make such inspection of physical facilities and any and all financial, operational or other documents and other information as may be relevant to the divestitures required by this Revised Final Judgment.
After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the parties and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestitures ordered under this Revised Final Judgment; provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports may be filed under seal for in camera review. Such reports shall include the name, address and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the business to be divested, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the businesses to be divested.
If the trustee has not accomplished such divestitures within six (6) months after its appointment, the trustee thereupon shall file promptly with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestitures; (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestitures have not been accomplished; and (3) the trustee's recommendations; provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports may be filed under seal for in camera review. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the parties, who shall each have the right to be heard and to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court shall enter thereafter such orders as it shall deem appropriate in order to carry out the purpose of the trust which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the plaintiffs, subject to Section XII.
VI. NOTIFICATION
Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive agreement, contingent upon compliance with the terms of this Revised Final Judgment, to effect, in whole or in part, any proposed divestitures pursuant to Section IV or Section V, Aetna or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestitures, shall notify the United States and the State of Texas of the proposed divestitures. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify Aetna. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed transaction and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered to, or expressed an interest in or a desire to, acquire any ownership interest in the businesses to be divested that is the subject of the binding contract, together with full details of same. Within ten (10) calendar days of their receipt of such notice, the United States or the State of Texas may request from Aetna, the trustee, the proposed purchaser, or any other third party additional information concerning the proposed divestitures and the proposed purchaser. Aetna and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested from them within ten (10) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after the plaintiffs have been provided the additional information requested from Aetna, the trustee, the proposed purchaser, and any third party, whichever is later, the plaintiffs, in their sole discretion, subject to Section XII, shall provide written notice to Aetna and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether it objects to the proposed divestitures. If the plaintiffs provide written notice to Aetna and the trustee that they do not object, then the divestitures may be consummated, subject only to Aetna's limited right to object to the sale under Section V.B. Absent written notice that the plaintiffs do not object to the proposed purchaser or upon objection by the plaintiffs, such divestitures proposed under Section IV or Section V may not be consummated. Upon objection by Aetna under Section V.B, a divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VII. AFFIDAVITS
Within twenty-five (25) calendar days of the June 21, 1999 filing of the original Hold Separate Order and Stipulation in this matter and every thirty (30) calendar days thereafter until the divestitures have been completed, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V, Aetna shall deliver to the United States and the State of Texas an affidavit as to the fact and manner of compliance with Section IV or Section V. Each such affidavit shall include, inter alia, the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, at any time after the period covered by the last such report, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring any interest in the business to be divested, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts that Aetna has made to solicit a buyer for NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest and to provide required information to prospective purchasers including the limitations, if any, on such information.
Within twenty-five (25) calendar days of the June 21, 1999 filing of the original Hold Separate Order and Stipulation in this matter, Aetna shall deliver to the United States and the State of Texas an affidavit that describes in detail all actions Aetna has taken and all steps Aetna has implemented on an on-going basis to preserve NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest pursuant to Section VIII and the Revised Hold Separate Stipulation and Order previously entered by this Court. The affidavit also shall describe, but not be limited to, Aetna's efforts to maintain and operate NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest as active competitors, and the plans and timetable for Aetna's integration of Prudential's healthcare assets. Aetna shall deliver to the United States and the State of Texas an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in Aetna's earlier affidavit(s) filed pursuant to this Section VII.B within fifteen (15) calendar days after such change is implemented.
Until one year after the divestitures required by this Revised Final Judgment have been completed, Aetna shall preserve all records of all efforts made to preserve the businesses to be divested and effect the divestitures.
VIII. HOLD SEPARATE ORDER
Until the divestitures required by this Revised Final Judgment have been accomplished, Aetna shall take all steps necessary to comply with Section IV and the Revised Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered by this Court, to preserve the assets of NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest, and to ensure that NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest remain viable competitors in the sale of HMO and HMO-based POS plans in Dallas and Houston. Defendants shall take no action that would jeopardize the divestitures of NYLCare-Gulf Coast and NYLCare-Southwest.
IX. FINANCING
Aetna is ordered and directed not to finance all or any part of any purchase by an acquirer(s) made pursuant to Section IV or Section V.

IV.
DIVESTITURES
A. Defendants are ordered and directed, within ninety (90) calendar days after the filing of the Complaint in this matter, or five (5) days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by this Court, whichever is later, to
divest the VTNA LCOE Truck Business in a manner consistent with this Final Judgment as a viable ongoing business to a purchaser acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion;
enter into an agreement with the purchaser of the VTNA LCOE Truck Business whereby defendants guarantee that the VTNA LCOE Truck Business will be able to use engines which meet United States Environmental Protection Agency 2002 emissions requirements; and
at the option of the purchaser of the VTNA LCOE Truck Business, enter into an agreement to supply reasonable levels of transitional and manufacturing start-up support for a maximum period of 2 years that will enable the purchaser or purchasers to produce VTNA LCOE Trucks.
B. Defendants agree to use their best efforts to divest the VTNA LCOE Truck Business as expeditiously as possible. The United States, in its sole discretion, may extend the time period for the divestiture two additional periods of time, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days each, and shall notify this Court in such circumstances.
C. In accomplishing the divestiture ordered by this Final Judgment, defendants promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of the VTNA LCOE Truck Business. Defendants shall inform any person making inquiry regarding a possible purchase of the VTNA LCOE Truck Business that it is being divested pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide that person with a copy of this Final Judgment. Defendants shall offer to furnish to all prospective purchasers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information and documents relating to the VTNA LCOE Truck Business customarily provided in a due diligence process, except such information or documents subject to the attorney-client or attorney work-product privileges. Defendants shall make available such information to the United States at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
D. Defendants shall provide the purchaser and the United States information relating to any AB Volvo or VTNA personnel involved in the research, design, production, operation, development, marketing and sale of the VTNA LCOE Truck Business to enable the purchaser to make offers of employment. Defendants will not interfere with any negotiations by the purchaser to employ any person whose primary responsibility is the research, design, production, operation, development, marketing or sale of the VTNA LCOE Truck Business.
E. Defendants shall permit prospective purchasers of the VTNA LCOE Truck Business to have reasonable access to personnel and to make inspections of the physical facilities of the VTNA business to be divested; access to any and all environmental, zoning, and other permit documents and information; and access to any and all financial, sales, marketing, operational, or other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.
F. Defendants shall warrant to the purchaser of the VTNA LCOE Truck Business that each asset of the VTNA LCOE Truck Business will be operational on the date of sale.

J. Unless the United States consents in writing, the divestiture pursuant to Section IV of this Final Judgment, whether by defendants or by a trustee appointed pursuant to Section VI of this Final Judgment, shall include the entire VTNA LCOE Truck Business as defined in Section II. The divestiture of the VTNA LCOE Truck Business shall be accomplished by selling or otherwise conveying the VTNA LCOE Truck Business to a purchaser in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that business to be divested can and will be used by the purchaser as part of a viable, ongoing LCOE Truck business. The divestiture of the VTNA LCOE Truck Business, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section VI of this Final Judgment, shall be made to a purchaser in a manner so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that it: (1) has the capability and intent of competing effectively in the development, production and sale of LCOE Trucks; (2) has the managerial, operational, technical and financial capability to compete effectively in the development, production and sale of LCOE Trucks; and (3) is not hindered by the terms of any agreement between the purchaser and defendants that gives either defendant the ability unreasonably to raise the purchaser's costs, to lower the purchaser's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere with the ability of the purchaser to compete effectively.
V.
NOTICE OF PROPOSED DIVESTITURES
Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive agreement, contingent upon compliance with the terms of this Final Judgment, to effect, in whole or in part, any proposed divestiture pursuant to Sections IV or VI of this Final Judgment, defendants or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture, shall notify the United States of the proposed divestiture. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestiture and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered to, or expressed an interest in or a desire to, acquire any ownership interest in the VTNA LCOE Business, together with full details of same. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the United States of such divestiture notice, the United States may request from defendants, the proposed purchaser, any other third party, or the trustee if applicable, additional information concerning the proposed divestiture, the proposed purchaser, and any other potential purchaser. Defendants and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested from them within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice, or within twenty (20) calendar days after the United States has been provided the additional information requested from the defendants, the proposed purchaser, any third party, or the trustee, whichever is later, the United States shall each provide written notice to defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States provides written notice to defendants (and the trustee if applicable) that it does not object, then the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to defendants' limited right to object to the sale under Section VI(B) of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed purchaser or upon objection by the United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or Section VI may not be consummated. Upon objection by defendants under the provision in Section VI(C), a divestiture proposed under Section VI shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VI.
APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE
A. If defendants have not divested the VTNA LCOE Truck Business within the time period specified in Section IV(A), defendants shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestiture of the VTNA or Mack LCOE Truck Business. The trustee shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to sell either the VTNA LCOE Truck Business or the Mack LCOE Truck Business. The trustee shall also have the right, in its sole discretion, and upon notice to the defendants and upon consultation with the United States, to add such other assets and agreements concerning necessary parts and components, in order to ensure the viability, competitiveness, and marketability of the Mack LCOE Truck Business.
B. After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the VTNA or Mack LCOE Truck Business. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture at the earliest possible time to a purchaser acceptable to the United States at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable for the VTNA or Mack LCOE Truck Business, upon a reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, and VI of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as the Court shall deem appropriate.

E. Defendants shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture pursuant to this Section. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the VTNA and Mack LCOE Truck Businesses, and defendants shall develop financial or other information relevant to such businesses as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to reasonable protection for trade secrets or other confidential research, development or commercial information.

Such reports shall include the name, address and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the VTNA or Mack LCOE Truck Business, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the VTNA or Mack LCOE Truck Business.
G.

To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the United States, who shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court shall enter thereafter such orders as it shall deem appropriate in order to carry out the purpose of this Final Judgment which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.

IV. Divestiture
A. Defendants are ordered and directed, within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the date of filing of this Amended Final Judgment, or five (5) days after notice of the entry of this Amended Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to divest Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business in a manner consistent with this Amended Final Judgment to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion.

Defendants agree to use their best efforts to divest Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business as expeditiously as possible.
B. In accomplishing the divestiture ordered by this Amended Final Judgment, defendants promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business, whichever is then available for sale. Defendants shall inform any person making inquiry regarding a possible purchase of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business that either will be divested pursuant to this Amended Final Judgment and provide that person with a copy of this Amended Final Judgment. Defendants shall offer to furnish to all prospective Acquirers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information and documents relating to Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business, whichever is then available for sale, customarily provided in a due diligence process except such information or documents subject to the attorney-client or work-product privilege. Defendants shall make available such information to the United States at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
C. Defendants shall provide prospective Acquirers of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business and the United States information relating to the personnel involved in the production, operation, development, and sale of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business (whichever is then available for sale) to enable the Acquirer to make offers of employment. Defendants will not interfere with any negotiations by the Acquirer to employ any of the defendants' employees whose responsibilities includes the production, operation, development, or sale of the products of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business.
D. Defendants shall permit prospective Acquirers of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business to have reasonable access to personnel and to make inspections of the physical facilities of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business (whichever is then available for sale); access to any and all environmental, zoning, and other permit documents and information; and access to any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.
E. Defendants shall warrant to the Acquirer of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business that each asset that was operational as of the date of filing of the Complaint in this matter will be operational on the date of divestiture.
F. Defendants shall not take any action that will impede in any way the permitting, operation, or divestiture of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business.
G. Defendants shall not take any action, direct or indirect, that would prevent or discourage in any way any dealer from distributing the products of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business for a period of two years after such divestiture. Nothing in this provision, however, shall prevent defendants from promoting and selling in the ordinary course of business products that compete with those of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business.
H. Defendants shall warrant to the Acquirer of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business that there are no material defects in the environmental, zoning, or other permits pertaining to the operation of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business, and that following the sale of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business, defendants will not undertake, directly or indirectly, any challenges to the environmental, zoning, or other permits relating to the operation of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business.
I. Nothing in this Amended Final Judgment shall be construed to require the Acquirer as a condition of any license granted by or to defendants pursuant Sections II (E) and IV (or Sections II (F) and IV) to extend to defendants the right to use the Acquirer's improvements to any of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business.
J. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, the divestiture pursuant to Section IV, or by trustee appointed pursuant to Section V, of this Amended Final Judgment, shall include the entire Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business, and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business can and will be used by the Acquirer as part of a viable, ongoing business, engaged in developing, manufacturing, and selling brazing sheet in North America. Divestiture of Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business may be made to an Acquirer, provided that it is demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of the United States that the divested brazing sheet business will remain viable and that divestiture of such assets will remedy the competitive harm alleged in the Complaint. The divestiture, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V of this Amended Final Judgment,
Shall be made to an Acquirer that, in the United States's sole judgment, has the managerial, operational, and financial capability to compete effectively in the development, manufacture, and sale of brazing sheet in North America; and
Shall be accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that none of the terms of any agreement between an Acquirer and defendants give defendants the ability unreasonably to raise the Acquirer's costs, to lower the Acquirer's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the Acquirer to compete effectively.
V. Appointment of Trustee to Effect Divestiture
A. If defendants have not divested Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business within the time period specified in Section IV(A), defendants shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestiture of Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business.
B. After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, and VI of this Amended Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court deems appropriate. Subject to Section V(D) of this Amended Final Judgment, the trustee may hire at the cost and expense of defendants any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents, who shall be solely accountable to the trustee, reasonably necessary in the trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture.
C. Defendants shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by defendants must be conveyed in writing to the United States and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VI.
D. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of defendants, on such terms and conditions as plaintiff approves, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to defendants and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of the trustee and any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished, but timeliness is paramount.
E. Defendants shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the business to be divested, and defendants shall develop financial and other information relevant to such business as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to customary confidentiality protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture.
F. After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the United States and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestiture ordered under this Amended Final Judgment. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business.
G. If the trustee has not accomplished such divestiture within six months after its appointment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture; (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestiture has not been accomplished; and (3) the trustee's recommendations. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the plaintiff who shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Amended Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include, without limitation, extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VI. Notice of Proposed Divestiture
A. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, defendants or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture required herein, shall notify the United States of any proposed divestiture required by Section IV or V of this Amended Final Judgment. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestiture and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered or expressed an interest in or desire to acquire any ownership interest in Alcan's or Pechiney's Brazing Sheet Business, together with full details of the same.

Defendants and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
C. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after the United States has been provided the additional information requested from defendants, the proposed Acquirer, any third party, and the trustee, whichever is later, the United States shall provide written notice to defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States provides written notice that it does not object, the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to defendants' limited right to object to the sale under Section V(C) of this Amended Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed Acquirer or upon objection by the United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or Section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by defendants under Section V(C), a divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.

INTRODUCTION
Honeywell International, Inc. (""Honeywell""), successor in interest to defendant Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation (""Allied""), has moved to terminate the Final Judgment entered by the Court in this matter on May 29, 1941 (""Final Judgment""). A copy of the Final Judgment is attached as Appendix 1. After conducting an investigation as to the likely effects of the proposed termination that included soliciting public comments on the proposed termination, the United States has concluded that the Final Judgment is no longer necessary to protect competition and that its continued existence does not otherwise provide any public benefit. Moreover, the continued existence of the Final Judgment may be deterring Honeywell from offering new products and services, which could potentially benefit consumers in the marketplace. Accordingly, the United States consents to Honeywell's motion to terminate the Final Judgment, subject to further notice and comment, if any, as may be deemed necessary by the Court.(1)
The marketplace has changed dramatically since the Final Judgment was entered over sixty-five years ago: many of the products described in the Complaint, a copy of which is attached as Appendix 2, are no longer manufactured in any significant quantities; one of the two named defendants charged in the alleged conspiracy is no longer in the relevant business; and numerous new firms and products now exist. In essence, the industry has evolved such that the competitive problems alleged in the Complaint are no longer a cause for concern.
Honeywell has provided public notice of its request to terminate the Final Judgment and the United States solicited comments regarding the proposed termination. No comments were received. As discussed in Section V below, while we do not believe that further notice or comment is needed, the United States defers to the Court as to whether any additional public notice and comment period is necessary prior to terminating this judgment.
BACKGROUND OF THE 1941 CAUSE OF ACTION
The Products at Issue
The original case concerned anticompetitive acts in the United States during the 1930s and early 1940s relating to sales of ""fertilizer nitrogen."" Nitrogen is used as a nutrient in fertilizer chiefly to enhance crop growth. At the time of the Complaint, the nitrogen-based fertilizer industry was comprised of (and the Complaint focused on) the following fertilizer nitrogen products: synthetic ammonia solutions, nitrate of soda, ammonium sulfate, cal-nitro, anhydrous ammonia, and uramon. These products, which differed in terms of their respective nitrogen content and other properties, were mostly used as ingredients in the preparation of mixed fertilizers sold to farmers.
During this time period, the defendants ยญ Allied and E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company (""DuPont"") ยญ were responsible for production and marketing of most fertilizer nitrogen products. All nitrate of soda produced in the United States was produced by the Solvay Process Company (a subsidiary of Allied). Numerous steel plants, coke oven facilities, and gas plants throughout the United States produced ammonium sulfate but, as described below, the Barrett Company (also a subsidiary of Allied) was responsible for a significant portion of domestic sales pursuant to exclusive agency sales contracts with numerous producers. DuPont and Solvay manufactured anhydrous ammonia and DuPont manufactured uramon. Cal-Nitro was produced by manufacturers located in Europe but its domestic sales were made pursuant to the world-wide conspiracy described in the Complaint.
The Allegations in the Complaint
On May 29, 1941, the United States filed a Complaint against Allied, its subsidiaries and affiliates, DuPont, and 17 individuals who were agents, officers, and directors of the defendant corporations. The Complaint charged two distinct offenses:
First, the Complaint alleged that the corporate defendants, Allied and DuPont, acting by and through the individual defendants, violated Sections 1-3 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 1-3, by conspiring to restrain trade and commerce in the sale of fertilizer nitrogen, and by conspiring to monopolize and monopolizing such trade and commerce. Complaint, ยถ 40. The defendants effectuated this conspiracy through several means, including engaging in acts to control the importation and exportation of fertilizer nitrogen into and out of the United States, ยถยถ 41-44 & 51-55; restricting competition in sales of fertilizer nitrogen to purchasers in United States territories, ยถยถ 45-50; selling various fertilizer nitrogen products at uniform prices and agreeing on uniform freight terms relating to such sales, ยถยถ 56-59; and discouraging entry or expansion by competitors, ยถ 60.
Second, the Complaint alleged that the Barrett Company (""Barrett""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allied, violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1, by entering into contracts in restraint of trade in ammonium sulfate. Complaint, ยถ 61. Barrett allegedly sought to control substantially all of the sales of ammonium sulfate produced in the United States in order to ""dominate the market"" and fix non-competitive prices. Id. To accomplish this goal, Barrett obtained contracts from numerous ammonium sulfate producers appointing Barrett as their sole and exclusive agent for the sale of all their ammonium sulfate. At the time of the Complaint, Barrett had secured approximately thirty-seven exclusive agency sales contracts with producers accounting for more than 55% of the nation's ammonium sulfate production. ยถยถ 63-68. In addition, Barrett purchased substantial quantities of ammonium sulfate from other producers in order to keep that product off the market. ยถยถ 69-71. Barrett, through its exclusive contracts and purchases, controlled approximately 77% of all ammonium sulfate for the 1938-1939 ""fertilizer year,"" thereby giving it the ability to fix prices and monopolize trade in ammonium sulfate. ยถยถ 72-75.
The Final Judgment
Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, the Court, with the consent of the parties, entered the Final Judgment. It sought to remedy the harm from the two offenses outlined in the Complaint. With respect to the conspiracy claims, it enjoined Allied and DuPont from conspiring with each other (or, in certain instances, with other producers) to fix the prices or other competitive terms of sale of certain fertilizer nitrogen products. Final Judgment, ยง VI.(2) It also enjoined Allied and its subsidiaries from conspiring with certain foreign nitrate companies or any other producers or distributors of fertilizer nitrogen products with regard to fixing prices or other terms of sales relating to nitrate of soda. Id. ยง III.
With respect to the claims based on Barrett's efforts to secure agency contracts for sales of ammonium sulfate, Section V of the Final Judgment enjoined Barrett from:
entering into exclusive agency sales contracts with producers of ammonium sulfate;
selling, as agent or reseller, for consumption in the United States more than 35 percent of the net total domestic production of ammonium sulfate;(3)
conspiring with any producer of a fertilizer nitrogen to fix ammonium sulfate prices or restrain importation of ammonium sulfate;
purchasing ammonium sulfate from any producer under a contract or arrangement for the sole purpose of keeping ammonium sulfate off the market;
reducing the price of ammonium sulfate sold on behalf of a producer in order to discourage the production of ammonium sulfate by the producer; and
discriminating against bona fide cooperatives in the sale of ammonium sulfate.
Id. ยง V. Honeywell asserts that it has complied with all the terms of the Final Judgment.
LEGAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO THE TERMINATION OF AN ANTITRUST FINAL JUDGMENT WITH THE CONSENT OF THE UNITED STATES
This Court has jurisdiction to terminate the Final Judgment pursuant to Section VIII of the Final Judgment and ""principles inherent in the jurisdiction of the chancery."" United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 114 (1932); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 827 F.2d 868, 873 (2d Cir. 1987). Pursuant to Rule 60(b)(5) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, ""[o]n motion and upon terms as are just, the court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment . . . [when] it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.""
Where, as here, the United States consents to termination of an antitrust judgment, the issue before the court is whether such termination is in the public interest. United States v. IBM Corp., 163 F.3d 737, 740 (2d Cir. 1998) (affirming grant of joint motion by United States and defendant to terminate antitrust consent decree); United States v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 719 F.2d 558, 565 (2d Cir. 1983); United States v. Loew's, Inc., 783 F. Supp. 211, 213 (S.D.N.Y. 1992). The applicable ""public interest"" standard is derived from the purpose of the antitrust laws, IBM, 163 F.3d at 740, which is to protect competition. E.g., United States v. Penn-Olin Chem. Co., 378 U.S. 158, 170 (1964). The relevant question before the Court, therefore, is whether termination would serve the public interest in preserving ""free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade."" Loew's, 783 F. Supp. at 214 (quoting N. Pac. Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 4 (1958)).
The United States' assessment of this issue is entitled to substantial deference, similar to the broad deference it is accorded in settling antitrust litigation on terms that will best serve the public interest in competition. E.g., Sam Fox Publ'g Co. v. United States, 366 U.S. 683, 689 (1961).(4) The court should approve a consensual judgment termination where the United States has provided a reasonable explanation to support the conclusion that termination is consistent with the public interest. Loew's, 783 F. Supp. at 214; see also United States v. W. Elec. Co., 900 F.2d 283, 307 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (holding that the district court should approve an uncontested termination under the public interest test ""so long as the resulting array of rights and obligations is within the zone of settlements consonant with the public interest today"").
TERMINATION IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THE FINAL JUDGMENT IS NO LONGER NEEDED TO PROTECT COMPETITION
The purpose of the Final Judgment was to end the alleged conspiracy, prevent its likely recurrence, and prevent the defendants from monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the nitrogen fertilizer industry. The Final Judgment should be terminated as market conditions and participants have changed in such ways that its continued existence is no longer needed to protect competition.
The Division's extensive experience with the enforcement of the antitrust laws has shown that, as a general matter, industries evolve and change over time in response to competitive and technological forces. In most situations, the passage of many decades results in significant industry change that renders the rigid prohibitions placed years before in consent decrees either irrelevant to the parties' ongoing compliance with the antitrust laws, or an affirmative impediment to the kind of adaptation to change that is a hallmark of the competitive process.
These considerations, among others, led the Division in 1979 to establish a policy of including in every consent decree a so-called ""sunset provision"" that, except in exceptional cases, would result in the decree's automatic termination after no more than ten years.(5) As a result of the Division's consistent adherence to this policy, the only antitrust consent decrees to which the United States is a party that remain in effect are those entered within the past ten years, or before 1979 when the ""sunset"" policy was adopted. The Division encourages parties to old decrees to seek the Division's consent to their termination, especially where they contain provisions that may be restricting competition. See U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, DOJ Bull. No. 1984-04, Statement of Policy by the Antitrust Division Regarding Enforcement of Permanent Injunctions Entered in Government Antitrust Cases; and U.S. Department of Justice Press Release, New Protocol to Expedite Review Process for Terminating or Modifying Older Antitrust Decrees (Apr. 13, 1999).(6) In the United States' view, decrees entered prior to 1979 should be terminated unless there are affirmative reasons for continuing them, which we would expect to exist only in limited circumstances.(7)
Termination of the Final Judgment in this case adheres to the principles underlying this long-standing effort to end decrees that are no longer needed to protect competition. First, the fertilizer nitrogen industry has evolved over time to become significantly more competitive. Second, the Final Judgment's broad conspiracy-related prohibitions are no longer relevant because DuPont has left the market and Honeywell has a significantly reduced presence than it had at the time of the Complaint. (The defendants, of course, remain subject to the antitrust laws, which, with enhanced penalties for per se violations, are a significantly greater deterrent to anticompetitive activity than a civil decree.) Third, the terms of the Final Judgment may be chilling Honeywell from engaging in the potentially procompetitive act of introducing a new product.
Industry Changes Since the Filing of the Final Judgment
The nitrogen fertilizer market(8) has changed dramatically since the Final Judgment was entered in 1941. At that time, the defendant corporations controlled, by means of production, contract, or purchase, substantially all of the market for nitrogen fertilizer products. Today, there are at least eleven major domestic producers of nitrogen fertilizer products such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and urea. See, e.g., ""North American Fertilizer Capacity,"" Market Information Unit, Market Development Division, IFDC, September, 2006. There are also numerous domestic producers of ammonia, which, in various forms, can be used to produce nitrogen fertilizer. Moreover, one of the two alleged conspirators, DuPont, no longer produces nitrogen fertilizer products, and the other, Honeywell, manufactures and distributes only one such product, ammonium sulfate. In addition to domestic production, foreign imports are firmly established in the United States, with net imports accounting for 50% of nitrogen fertilizer consumption in the United States.
At the time the Final Judgment was entered, ammonium sulfate was the most widely used nitrogen fertilizer. Today, it comprises only about 5% of the approximately 12 million tons of nitrogen consumed as a nutrient in the fertilizer market. Several other nitrogen fertilizer products subject to the Final Judgment ยญ nitrate of soda, cal-nitro, and uramon ยญ are competitively insignificant with respect to the overall nitrogen fertilizer market, while certain nitrogen products prevalent in the market today ยญ urea ammonium nitrate, urea, anhydrous ammonia, and ammonium nitrate ยญ were not subject to the terms of the Final Judgment.
When the Final Judgment was entered, Barrett purchased ammonium sulfate from producers and effectively controlled nearly 80% of domestic ammonium sulfate sales. Today, Barrett's successor, Honeywell, accounts for approximately 31% of domestic ammonium sulfate sales. It produces ammonium sulfate as a byproduct of its production of the chemical caprolactum (which means that, should Honeywell attempt to anticompetitively restrict output of ammonium sulfate in order to increase its price, Honeywell would incur significant storage and disposal costs for the excess ammonium sulfate withheld from the market, thereby making such a strategy highly unlikely to be profitable). There are also five significant producers of ammonium sulfate who have their own established distribution networks: DSM NV, BASF AG, The J.R. Simplot Company, Agrium, Inc., and the Dakota Gasification Co.
The Prohibitions on Conspiratorial Conduct Are Not Relevant Because DuPont Has Left the Market and Honeywell Has a Significantly Reduced Presence
Sections III, IV, V.A.3, and VI of the Final Judgment enjoin agreements between DuPont and Allied (as well as between Allied and others) to restrain trade with respect to certain fertilizer nitrogen products. These broad conspiracy-related prohibitions are no longer needed. First, DuPont no longer produces or sells fertilizer nitrogen products. The only fertilizer nitrogen product that Honeywell (as successor to Allied) produces is ammonium sulfate. The general conspiracy-related judgment provisions, however, enjoin agreements and practices relating to fertilizer nitrogen products in addition to ammonium sulfate. Accordingly, the principal harm alleged in the Complaint ยญ DuPont and Allied effectuating a conspiracy between themselves that would exert significant control over the fertilizer nitrogen industry ยญ is no longer a concern. While it is possible that an actionable conspiracy may occur should Honeywell conspire with others, the continued existence of the Final Judgment is not needed to police such a possibility. Cf. IBM, 163 F.3d at 742 (""[T]he purpose of an antitrust decree is to remedy and prevent the recurrence of the violation alleged in the complaint. Where the government has consented to termination, the focus is on whether there is a likelihood of potential future violation, rather than the mere possibility of a violation."" (emphasis added)).
Second, many of the conspiracy-related provisions simply duplicate existing antitrust laws. After the passage of decades, judgment provisions that in substance require defendants to abide by the antitrust laws add little, if anything, to antitrust compliance. The remedies available under current antitrust statutes for criminal antitrust violations such as hard-core price-fixing and market allocation are generally more severe than those for contempt of an outstanding judgment and therefore serve as a greater deterrent to resumption of the challenged anticompetitive conduct than the threat of contempt proceedings. Cf. Loew's, 783 F.Supp. at 214 (holding that termination of an antitrust decree leaves the parties ""fully subject to the antitrust laws of general application"").
The Agency Sales Contract Restrictions Are Not Needed to Deter Anticompetitive Conduct and May Chill Potentially Procompetitive Behavior
Section V restricts Honeywell's (as successor to Barrett) practices with respect to acting as an agent or reseller of ammonium sulfate. This relief sought to prevent the recurrence of Barrett's efforts to fix prices through its control of the marketing of a significant portion of the ammonium sulfate domestic production capacity. The restrictions, however, are no longer needed as it is unlikely that Honeywell could engage in such conduct. First, Honeywell does not possess market power over nitrogen fertilizers. Since the Final Judgment was entered, the nitrogen fertilizer industry has changed dramatically and become significantly more competitive. There are nearly a dozen major producers of nitrogen fertilizers and ammonium sulfate is produced by five competitors in addition to Honeywell. Honeywell has not entered agency sales contracts with these five competitors ยญ each of whom has its own established distribution network ยญ and has stated that it has no intention to do so. If Honeywell should attempt to monopolize the industry through anticompetitive contracts in the future, it would be subject to the antitrust laws.
Moreover, the restrictions on Honeywell may chill potentially procompetitive conduct. Honeywell states that it plans to market a new nitrogen fertilizer product that would combine ammonium sulfate with another product to create a new type of fertilizer with unique qualities. To do so, it would need to purchase ammonium sulfate as its own production capacity is limited. Honeywell also seeks to expand its ammonium sulfate sales in the Western United States by purchasing ammonium sulfate produced as a by-product in power plants and other industrial factories and reselling it to fertilizer customers. The viability of these proposed projects, which could increase competition, may be affected by the Final Judgment's restrictions on purchasing and reselling ammonium sulfate.(9)
PROPOSED PROCEDURES FOR PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PUBLIC NOTICE OF THE PENDING MOTION AND INVITING ADDITIONAL COMMENT, SHOULD THE COURT DETERMINE IT IS NECESSARY
In United States v. Swift & Co., the court noted its responsibility to implement procedures that will provide non-parties adequate notice of, and an opportunity to comment upon, antitrust judgment modifications proposed by consent of the parties:
Cognizant . . . of the public interest in competitive economic activity, established chancery powers and duties, and the occasional fallibility of the Government, the court is, at the very least, obligated to ensure that the public, and all interested parties, have received adequate notice of the proposed modification . . . .
1975-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) ยถ 60,201, at 65,703 (N.D. Ill. 1975) (footnote omitted). There has been sufficient notice and opportunity for comment in this case.
Early in the course of its investigation of Honeywell's proposal to terminate the Final Judgment, the United States asked Honeywell ยญ and it agreed ยญ to publish notice of its proposal and provide the public an opportunity to submit comments to the United States. The notice was published in two widely read industry publications: Ferticon Nitrogen Report (October 19, 2006) and Fertilizer Week (October 20, 2006). See Appendix 3. Moreover, the United States conducted interviews with numerous market participants during the course of its investigation, further raising awareness of Honeywell's proposal. The United States did not receive any comments relating to the proposed motion to terminate the Final Judgment. The United States believes that these advance publications of Honeywell's pending proposal provided sufficient public notice and opportunity to comment on the pending motion for termination of the Final Judgment.(10)
Antitrust Division policies that were in place when Honeywell published its notice in October 2006 called for additional notice and comment procedures after the filing of a motion to terminate. In cases such as this, however, where notice was published informing interested parties that the Division was considering the potential termination of the Final Judgment, and where interested parties had the opportunity to submit comments to the Division to be taken into account in the Division's analysis, the Division no longer believes that further notice automatically should be required.
If the Court agrees that no further notice is necessary, the United States requests that the Court enter an order terminating the Final Judgment. See Attachment A to the Stipulation. If the Court, however, concludes that further notice and comment are appropriate in this matter, the United States requests that the Court promptly enter the stipulated order providing for the following procedures (see Attachment C to the Stipulation), which are consistent with those used in previous judgment termination motions:
The United States will publish in The Federal Register a notice announcing the motion to terminate the Final Judgment and the United States' consent to it (subject to its right to withdraw its consent), summarizing the Complaint and Final Judgment, describing the procedures for inspecting and obtaining copies of relevant papers, and inviting the submission of comments. See Attachment D to the Stipulation.
Honeywell will publish, at its own expense, notice of its motion in two consecutive issues of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The published notices will provide for public comment during the sixty (60) days following publication of the last notice. See Attachment B to the Stipulation.
Within a reasonable period of time after the conclusion of the sixty-day period, the United States will file with the Court copies of any written comments that it receives and its response to those comments.
The parties request that the Court not rule upon the Motion to Terminate for at least seventy (70) days after the last publication of the notices described above, i.e., for at least ten (10) days after the close of the period for public comment, and the United States reserves the right to withdraw its consent to the motion at any time prior to entry of an order terminating the Final Judgment.
This procedure is designed to provide additional notice to all potentially interested persons, informing them that the motion to terminate the Final Judgment is pending and providing them a further opportunity to comment thereon. Honeywell has agreed to follow this procedure, including publication of the appropriate notices, should the Court find it necessary.
The parties therefore submit to the Court three separate proposed orders: one that can be used to terminate the Final Judgment immediately (see Attachment A to the Stipulation), the second that establishes the additional notice and comment procedure outlined above (see Attachment C to the Stipulation), and the third that can be used to terminate the Final Judgment after any additional notice and comment period (see Attachment E to the Stipulation).
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, theUnited States consents to the termination of the Final Judgment, subject to its right to withdraw its consent to the motion at any time prior to entry of an order terminating the Final Judgment.

FOOTNOTES
1. The United States reserves its right to withdraw its consent to the motion at any time prior to entry of an order terminating the Final Judgment.
2. The Final Judgment also enjoined Allied and DuPont from individually refusing to allow customers to purchase synthetic ammonia solutions at the point of production, a practice that could be used to facilitate conspiratorial conduct. Final Judgment ยง VI.D; see also id. ยง IV (similar prohibition on Allied with respect to sales of nitrate of soda).
3. Section V.3 of the Final Judgment describes this amount as United States production plus imports minus exports, a quantity that is now usually referred to in the marketplace as ""apparent consumption."" It represents the amount of ammonium sulfate that remains in the United States and is presumably used here.
4. A district court applies the same public interest standard in terminating a consent decree as it does in reviewing the entry of an initial consent decree in a government antitrust case pursuant to the Tunney Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 16(e). See IBM, 163 F.3d at 740 (noting that while Tunney Act does not apply to judgment terminations, court should consider same public interest test); Loew's, 783 F.Supp. at 213.
5. Antitrust Division Manual, ยง IV.E.d.2. (1998 ed.). This change in policy followed Congress' 1974 amendment of the Sherman Act to make violations a felony, punishable by substantial fines and jail sentences. With these enhanced penalties for per se violations of the antitrust laws, the Division concluded that antitrust recidivists could be deterred more effectively by a successful criminal prosecution under the Sherman Act than by a criminal contempt proceeding under provisions of an old consent decree aimed at preventing a recurrence of price-fixing and other hard-core antitrust violations. United States v. Columbia Artists Mgmt., Inc., 662 F. Supp. 865, 867 (S.D.N.Y. 1987).
6. In addition, in the early 1980s, the Division conducted its own review of over 1,200 old consent decrees then in effect to ensure that none ""hinder[ed] . . . competition"" or ""reflect[ed] erroneous economic analysis and thus produce[d] continuing anticompetitive effects."" The Honorable William French Smith, Attorney General of the United States, Remarks at the Annual Meeting of the District of Columbia Bar (June 24, 1981), at 11. Although that effort was necessarily constrained by the Division's limited resources and other enforcement priorities, it did lead to the termination of several decrees that at the time appeared most problematic. See also Jeffrey I. Zuckerman, Removing the Judicial Fetters: The Antitrust Division's Judgment Review Project (1982) at 2-3, available at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f222000/222052c.htm; see Department of Justice Authorization for Fiscal Year 1984 Before the Subcommittee on Monopolies & Commercial Law, Committee on the Judiciary, 98th Cong. 16 (1983) (statement of William F. Baxter, Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division). Until the court has terminated a decree, of course, the parties thereto must scrupulously comply with the decree's terms.
7. Among the circumstances where continuation of a decree entered more than ten years ago may be in the public interest are: a pattern of noncompliance by the parties with significant provisions of the decree; a continuing need for the decree's restrictions to preserve a competitive industry structure; and longstanding reliance by industry participants on the decree as an essential substitute for other forms of industry-specific regulation where market failure cannot be remedied through structural relief. None of these circumstances is present in this case.
8. Nitrogen based fertilizers were referred to as ""fertilizer nitrogen"" in the Complaint and Final Judgment. The current industry term, however, is ""nitrogen fertilizer"" and this is the term that will be used in referring to the contemporary market.
9. See, e.g., United States v. IBM, 1997 WL 217588 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (terminating decree that had resulted in ""artificial restraints [on the defendant's practices] which do not further the cause of healthy competition""), aff'd, 163 F.3d 737 (2d Cir. 1998).
10. Notwithstanding the adequacy of that prior notice, the parties have agreed to certain procedures that may be followed in bringing this matter to a conclusion, as reflected in the Stipulation filed simultaneously with this memorandum."

DIVESTITURES
Milwaukee and Mansfield Areas
A. Defendants are hereby ordered and directed, in accordance with the terms of this Final Judgment, within ninety (90) calendar days after the filing of the Complaint in this matter, or five (5) days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to sell the Relevant Milwaukee Assets as a viable, ongoing business to a single purchaser acceptable to the United States, in its sole discretion, and to sell the Relevant Mansfield Assets, as a viable, ongoing business, to a single purchaser acceptable to the United States, in its sole discretion.

The United States, in its sole discretion, may extend the time period for any divestiture an additional period of time, not to exceed sixty (60) calendar days.
C. In accomplishing the divestitures ordered by this Final Judgment, defendants promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and Relevant Mansfield Assets. Defendants shall inform any person making an inquiry regarding a possible purchase that the sale is being made pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide such person with a copy of this Final Judgment. Defendants shall also offer to furnish to all prospective purchasers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information regarding the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and Relevant Mansfield Assets customarily provided in a due diligence process except such information or documents subject to attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product privilege. Defendants shall make available such information to the United States at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.

Defendants shall not interfere with any negotiations by any purchaser to employ any Allied or Superior employee who, prior to the entry of the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order, works at, or whose primary responsibility concerns, any disposal or hauling business that is part of the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and Relevant Mansfield Assets.

H. Defendants shall warrant to each purchaser of the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and Relevant Mansfield Assets that there are no material defects in the environmental, zoning, or other permits pertaining to the operation of each asset, and that following the divestiture of each asset, defendants will not undertake, directly or indirectly, any challenges to the environmental, zoning, or other permits or applications for permits or licenses pertaining to the operation of the asset.
I. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, the divestitures pursuant to Section IV, or by trustee appointed pursuant to Section VI of this Final Judgment, shall include all Relevant Milwaukee Assets and Relevant Mansfield Assets, and shall be accomplished by selling or otherwise conveying the assets to a purchaser in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and Relevant Mansfield Assets can and will be used by the purchaser as part of a viable, ongoing business or businesses engaged in waste disposal or hauling.

V.

BAN ON ACQUISITION
Leeper Area
A. Superior shall abandon the purchase agreement between Superior and Allied, dated August 4, 1999, to acquire the County Environmental Landfill located at 344 Walley Run Drive, Leeper, PA 16233 (""County Landfill""). Superior shall not directly or indirectly acquire or propose to acquire any assets of or any interest, including any financial, security, loan equity or management interest, in the County Landfill except as provided in Paragraph V(B).
B. If a new landfill opens in the Leeper area which accepts MSW, Superior may propose to acquire assets or an interest in the County Landfill but shall provide advance notification to the Antitrust Division of any such plan. The obligation to provide notice under this Paragraph is met when Superior files a premerger notification pursuant to the Hart Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18a (the ""HSR Act""). In the event that such a transaction is not subject to the reporting and waiting period requirements of the HSR Act, notification under this Paragraph shall be provided to the Antitrust Division in the same format as, and in accordance with, the instructions relating to the Notification and Report Form set forth in the appendix to Part 803 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations as amended, except that the information requested in Items 5 through 9 of the instructions must be provided only about the Leeper area. Notification shall be provided at least thirty (30) days prior to the acquisition of any such interest, and shall include, beyond what may be required by the applicable instructions, the names of the principal representatives of the parties to the agreement who negotiated the agreement, and any management or strategic plans discussing the proposed transaction. If, within the 30-day period after notification, representatives of the Antitrust Division make a written request for additional information, Superior shall not consummate the proposed transaction or agreement until twenty (20) days after submitting all such additional information. Early termination of the waiting periods in this Paragraph may be requested and, where appropriate, granted in the same manner as is applicable under the requirements and provisions of the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. This Paragraph shall be broadly construed, and any ambiguity or uncertainty regarding the filing of notice under this Paragraph shall be resolved in favor of filing notice.
VI.

APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE
A. If defendants have not divested the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and Relevant Mansfield Assets within the time period specified in Section IV(A), defendants shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestitures.
B. After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and Relevant Mansfield Assets. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture to a purchaser acceptable to the United States at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, VI, and VII of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as the Court deems appropriate. Subject to Section VI(D) of this Final Judgment, the trustee may hire at the cost and expense of defendants any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents, reasonably necessary in the trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture and such professionals and agents shall be accountable solely to the trustee.
C. Defendants shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by defendants must be conveyed in writing to the United States and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VII.
D. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of defendants, on such terms and conditions as the United States approves, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to defendants and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of such trustee and of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the divested assets and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestitures and the speed with which the divestitures are accomplished.
E. Defendants shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestitures. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and Relevant Mansfield Assets. Defendants shall develop financial and other information relevant to the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and Relevant Mansfield Assets customarily provided in a due diligence process as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to reasonable protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development or commercial information.
F. After the trustee's appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the parties and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestitures ordered under this Final Judgment. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and the Relevant Mansfield Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to sell the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and the Relevant Mansfield Assets.
G. If the trustee has not accomplished such divestitures within six months after its appointment, the trustee thereupon shall file promptly with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestitures, (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestitures have not been accomplished, and (3) the trustee's recommendations for completing the required divestitures. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the parties, who shall each have the right to be heard and to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court shall thereafter enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate in order to carry out the purpose of the trust which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VII.

NOTICE OF PROPOSED DIVESTITURES
A. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive agreement to effect, in whole or in part, any proposed divestiture pursuant to Section IV or VI of this Final Judgment, defendants or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture, shall notify the United States of the proposed divestiture. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestiture and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered to, or expressed an interest in or a desire to, acquire any ownership interest in the assets to be divested that are the subject of the binding contract, together with full details of same.
B. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the United States of such notice, the United States, in its sole discretion, may request from defendants, the proposed purchaser, any other third party, or the trustee, if applicable, additional information concerning the proposed divestiture and the proposed purchaser. Defendants and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested from them within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
C. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after the United States has been provided the additional information requested from defendants, the proposed purchaser, and any third party, whichever is later, the United States shall provide written notice to defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States provides written notice to defendants and the trustee, if applicable that it does not object, then the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to defendants' limited right to object to the sale under Section VI (C) of this Final Judgment. Upon objection by the United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or VI of this Final Judgment shall not be consummated. Upon objection by defendants under the provision in Section VI (C), a divestiture proposed under Section IV shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VIII.

AFFIDAVITS
A. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter and every twenty (20) calendar days thereafter until the divestitures have been completed pursuant to Section IV or VI of this Final Judgment, defendants shall deliver to the United States an affidavit as to the fact and manner of compliance with Section IV or VI of this Final Judgment. Each such affidavit shall include, inter alia, the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, at any time after the period covered by the last such report, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the assets to be divested, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts that defendants have taken to solicit a buyer for the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and Relevant Mansfield Assets and to provide required information to prospective purchasers, including the limitations, if any, on such information. Assuming the information set forth in the affidavit is true and complete, any objection by the United States to information provided by defendants, including limitations on information, shall be made within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such affidavit.
B. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, defendants shall deliver to the United States an affidavit which describes in detail all actions defendants have taken and all steps defendants have implemented on an ongoing basis to preserve the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and Relevant Mansfield Assets pursuant to Section IX of this Final Judgment. Defendants shall deliver to the United States an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in defendants' earlier affidavit(s) filed pursuant to this Section within fifteen (15) calendar days after any such change has been implemented.
C. For a one-year period following the completion of each divestiture, defendants shall preserve all records of any and all efforts made to preserve the Relevant Milwaukee Assets and Relevant Mansfield Assets that were divested and to effect the ordered divestitures.
IX.

HOLD SEPARATE ORDER
Until the divestitures required by the Final Judgment have been accomplished, defendants shall take all steps necessary to comply with the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered by this Court. Defendants shall take no action that would jeopardize the sale of the Relevant Milwaukee Assets or the Relevant Mansfield Assets.
X.

FINANCING
Defendants shall not finance all or any part of any purchase by any person made pursuant to Section IV or VI of this Final Judgment.
XI.

COMPLIANCE INSPECTION
A. For purposes of determining or securing compliance with the Final Judgment, or of determining whether the Final Judgment should be modified or vacated, and subject to any legally recognized privilege, from time to time, duly authorized representatives of the United States Department of Justice, including consultants and other persons retained by the United States, shall, upon written request of the Attorney General or of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, and on reasonable notice to defendants, be permitted:
Access during office hours of defendants to inspect and copy all books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda, and other records and documents in the possession or under the control of defendants, who may have counsel present, relating to the matters contained in this Final Judgment and the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order; and
To interview, either informally or on the record, their officers, employees, and agents, who may have counsel present, regarding any such matters. The interview shall be subject to reasonable convenience and without restraint or interference by defendants.
B. Upon the written request of the Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, defendants shall submit such written reports, under oath if requested, relating to any matter contained in the Final Judgment and the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order as may be requested.
C.

The United States, in its sole discretion in consultation with DoD, may extend the time period for any divestiture for an additional period of time not to exceed sixty (60) days.
C. In accomplishing the divestitures ordered by this Final Judgment, defendants shall make known promptly, by usual and customary means, the availability of the businesses to be divested pursuant to this Final Judgment. Defendants shall inform all persons making an inquiry regarding a possible purchase that the sale is being made pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide such person with a copy of this Final Judgment.

E. For a period of two years from the filing of the Complaint in this matter, defendants shall not solicit to hire, or hire, any individual listed in Confidential Attachment A who, within six (6) months of the date of sale of the Divested Business that employs the individual, receives a reasonable offer of employment from the approved purchaser of the Divested Business, unless such employee is terminated or laid off by the purchaser.

In order to foster the employment and retention of employees by the purchasers, AlliedSignal or Honeywell, as the case may be, shall, for each employee of the TCAS Business, the SSWR Business and the AlliedSignal MicroSCIRAS Business (or, as described below in Section VI, the Honeywell MEMS Business) who elects to be employed by the purchaser of the Divested Business, vest all unvested pension and other equity rights of that employee. For each such employee, AlliedSignal or Honeywell shall also provide all benefits to which the employee would have been entitled if terminated without cause, provided the employee is still employed by the purchaser at the end of the time period covered by such benefits.
F. Defendants shall take no action, direct or indirect, to impede in any way the operation of one or more of the businesses to be divested.

Prior to divestiture, each of the Divested Businesses shall be operated in place pursuant to the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered by this Court. Each such divestiture shall be accomplished by selling or otherwise conveying the business to be divested to a purchaser in such a way as to satisfy the United States and DoD, in their sole discretion, that the business to be divested can and will be used by the purchaser of the business as part of a viable ongoing business. Each divestiture, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section VI of this Final Judgment shall be made to a purchaser that has satisfied the United States and DoD, in their sole discretion, that it: (1) has the capability and intent of competing effectively in the development, production and sale of the relevant products; (2) has the managerial, operational, and financial capability to compete effectively in the development, production and sale of the relevant products; (3) is eligible to receive applicable DoD security clearances; and (4) is not hindered by the terms of any agreement between the purchaser and defendants that gives either defendant the ability unreasonably to raise the purchaser's costs, to lower the purchaser's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere with the ability of the purchaser to compete effectively.
I. Defendants shall comply with all agreements with DoD and all applicable United States laws and regulations, including those regarding the protection of classified information and export controls.
J. Defendants shall not charge to DoD any costs directly or indirectly incurred in complying with this Final Judgment.
V. NOTICE OF PROPOSED DIVESTITURES
A. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive agreement, contingent upon compliance with the terms of this Final Judgment, to effect, in whole or in part, any proposed divestitures pursuant to Sections IV or VI of this Final Judgment, defendants or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestitures, shall notify the United States and DoD of the proposed divestitures. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed transaction and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered to, or expressed an interest in or a desire to, acquire any ownership interest in the business to be divested that is the subject of the binding contract, together with full details of same. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the United States and DoD of such divestiture notice, the United States, in consultation with DoD, may request from defendants, the proposed purchaser, or any other third party additional information concerning the proposed divestiture and the proposed purchaser. Defendants and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested from them within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree. Within thirty (30) calendar days, after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after the United States and DoD have been provided the additional information requested from the defendants, the proposed purchaser, and any third party, whichever is later, the United States and DoD shall each provide written notice to defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States and DoD provide written notice to defendants (and the trustee if applicable) that they do not object, then the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to defendants' limited right to object to the sale under Section VI(B) of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States and DoD do not object to the proposed purchaser or upon objection by the United States or DoD, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or Section VI may not be consummated. Upon objection by defendants under the provision in Section VI(B), a divestiture proposed under Section VI shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
B. Purchasers of the Teterboro Space and Navigation Business and the AlliedSignal MicroSCIRAS Business (or, as described below in Section VI, the Honeywell MEMS Business) must be identified simultaneously by defendants, or by the applicable trustee, in order that the proposed divestitures may be reviewed jointly and approved together by the United States and DoD in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Final Judgment.
VI. APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEES
A. Immediately upon the filing of this Final Judgment, the United States may, in its sole discretion, nominate no more than two trustees, which the Court shall appoint. If two trustees are appointed, one trustee shall monitor the divestiture by defendants of the TCAS Business and the SSWR Business, and the other trustee shall monitor the divestiture by the defendants of the Teterboro Space and Navigation Business, the Cheshire Business, the AlliedSignal MicroSCIRAS Business, and the AlliedSignal MSA and MAG Technology Business. This procedure will enable each trustee to be familiar with all applicable divestiture issues in the event the trustee becomes responsible, pursuant to this Final Judgment, to divest all non-divested businesses the trustee is monitoring.
B. In the event that defendants have not divested all of the businesses required to be divested pursuant to this Final Judgment within the time specified in Section IV of this Final Judgment, only the trustee monitoring defendants' attempts to divest the non-divested business shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture of the non-divested businesses. If the AlliedSignal MicroSCIRAS Business has not been divested, the trustee responsible for divesting that business may, in its sole discretion, divest the Honeywell MEMS Business instead. For each non-divested business, the trustee shall seek to attain the best price then obtainable for the non-divested business upon a reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV and VI of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as the Court shall deem appropriate. Subject to Section VI(C) of this Final Judgment, each trustee shall have the power and authority to hire, after the time period described in section IV(A) and at the cost and expense of the defendants, any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents reasonably necessary in the judgment of the trustee to assist in the divestitures, and such professionals and agents shall be accountable solely to the trustee. The trustees shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestitures at the earliest possible time to a purchaser acceptable to the United States and DoD and shall have such other powers as this Court shall deem appropriate. Defendants shall not object to a divestiture by a trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by defendants must be conveyed in writing to the United States and the appropriate trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section V of this Final Judgment.
C. The trustees shall serve at the cost and expense of defendants, on customary and reasonable terms and conditions agreed to by the trustees and the United States, unless modified by the Court. Each trustee shall account for all monies derived from the sale of each asset sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to defendants and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of the trustees and of any professionals and agents retained by any trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the divested businesses and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustees with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestitures and the speed with which they are accomplished.
D. Defendants shall use their best efforts to assist the trustees to monitor carefully defendants' attempts to divest the businesses to be divested pursuant to the Final Judgment and, if necessary, to accomplish the required divestitures, including their best efforts to effect all necessary consents and regulatory approvals. Each trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have, to the extent permitted by law, full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the businesses to be divested by the trustee, and defendants shall develop financial or other information relevant to the businesses to be divested customarily provided in a due diligence process as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to customary confidentiality assurances.
E. After its appointment, each trustee shall file monthly reports with the parties and the Court setting forth either the defendants' or the trustee's efforts, whichever is applicable, to accomplish the divestitures ordered under this Final Judgment; provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that the trustee or the defendants deem confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. After the time period described in Section IV(A), such reports shall include the name, address and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the businesses to be divested, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the businesses to be divested.
F. If a trustee has not accomplished the divestiture of all non-divested businesses within six (6) months after it became responsible for selling the non-divested businesses, the trustee thereupon shall file promptly with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestitures, (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestitures have not been accomplished, and (3) the trustees recommendations; provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the parties, who shall each have the right to be heard and to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court shall enter thereafter such orders as it shall deem appropriate in order to carry out the purpose of the trust which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VII. AFFIDAVITS

Defendants shall deliver to the United States and DoD an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in defendants' earlier affidavit(s) filed pursuant to this Section within fifteen (15) calendar days after the change is implemented.
C. Until one year after each such divestiture has been completed, defendants shall preserve all records of all efforts made to preserve the business to be divested and to effect the ordered divestiture.

III. Applicability
This Final Judgment applies to AMC and Kerasotes, as defined above, and all other persons in active concert or participation with any of them who receive actual notice of this Final Judgment by personal service or otherwise.
If, prior to complying with Sections IV and V of this Final Judgment, Defendants sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets or of lesser business units that include the Divestiture Assets, they shall require the purchaser to be bound by the provisions of this Final Judgment. Defendants need not obtain such an agreement from the acquirers of the assets divested pursuant to this Final Judgment.
IV. Divestitures
AMC is ordered and directed, within sixty (60) calendar days after the filing of the Complaint in this matter, or five (5) calendar days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to divest the Divestiture Assets in a manner consistent with this Final Judgment to one or more Acquirer(s) acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate). The United States, in its sole discretion, may agree to one or more extensions of this time period, and shall notify the Court in such circumstances. AMC agrees to use its best efforts to divest the Divestiture Assets as expeditiously as possible.
In accomplishing the divestitures ordered by this Final Judgment, AMC promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of the Divestiture Assets. AMC shall inform any person making inquiry regarding a possible purchase of the Divestiture Assets that they are being divested pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide that person with a copy of this Final Judgment. AMC shall offer to furnish to all prospective Acquirers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information and documents relating to the Divestiture Assets customarily provided in a due diligence process except such information or documents subject to the attorney-client privilege or work-product doctrine. AMC shall make available such information to the Plaintiffs at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
AMC shall provide the Acquirer(s) and the United States information relating to the personnel involved in the operation of the Divestiture Assets to enable the Acquirer(s) to make offers of employment. Defendants will not interfere with any negotiations by the Acquirer(s) to employ any Defendant employee whose primary responsibility is the operation of the Divestiture Assets.
AMC shall permit prospective Acquirer(s) of the Divestiture Assets to have reasonable access to personnel and to make inspections of the physical facilities of the Divestiture Assets; access to any and all environmental, zoning, and other permit documents and information; and access to any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.
AMC shall warrant to Acquirer(s) of the Divestiture Assets that each asset will be operational on the date of sale.
Defendants shall not take any action that will impede in any way the permitting, operation, or divestitures of the Divestiture Assets. At the option of the Acquirer(s), AMC shall enter into an agreement for products and services, such as computer support services, that are reasonably necessary for the Acquirer(s) to effectively operate the Divestiture Assets during a transition period. The terms and conditions of any contractual arrangements meant to satisfy this provision must be commercially reasonable for those products and services for which the agreement is entered and shall remain in effect for no more than three months, absent approval of the United States, in its sole discretion (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate).
AMC shall warrant to the Acquirer(s) that there are no material defects in the environmental, zoning, or other permits pertaining to the operation of each asset. Following the sale of the Divestiture Assets, Defendants will not undertake, directly or indirectly, any challenges to the environmental, zoning, or other permits relating to the operation of the Divestiture Assets.
Unless the United States (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) otherwise consents in writing, the divestitures made pursuant to Section IV, or by trustee appointed pursuant to Section V of this Final Judgment, shall include the entire Divestiture Assets, and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) that the Divestiture Assets can and will be used by the Acquirer(s) as part of a viable, ongoing business of operating mainstream theatres that exhibit first-run, commercial movies. Divestitures of the Divestiture Assets may be made to one or more Acquirers, provided that in each instance it is demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of the United States (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) that the Divestiture Assets will remain viable and the divestitures of such assets will remedy the competitive harm alleged in the Complaint. The divestitures, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V of this Final Judgment,
shall be made to Acquirers that, in the United States' sole judgment (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) have the intent and capability (including the necessary managerial, operational, technical, and financial capability) of competing effectively in the business of mainstream theatres exhibiting first-run, commercial movies; and
shall be accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) that none of the terms of any agreement between Acquirers and Defendants give the ability unreasonably to raise the Acquirers' costs, to lower the Acquirers' efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the Acquirers to compete effectively.
V. Appointment of Trustee
If AMC has not divested the Divestiture Assets within the time period specified in Section IV(A), AMC shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestitures of the Divestiture Assets.
After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the Divestiture Assets. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestitures to Acquirer(s) acceptable to the United States (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, VI, and VII of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court deems appropriate. Subject to Section V(D) of this Final Judgment, the trustee may hire at the cost and expense of AMC any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents, who shall be solely accountable to the trustee, reasonably necessary in the trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture.
Defendants shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by Defendants must be conveyed in writing to the United States and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VII.
The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of AMC, on such terms and conditions as the United States approves, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to AMC and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of the trustee and any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the Divestiture Assets and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestitures and the speed with which it is accomplished, but timeliness is paramount.
Defendants shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestitures. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the business to be divested, and Defendants shall develop financial and other information relevant to such business as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to reasonable protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestitures.
After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the parties and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestitures ordered under this Final Judgment. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the Divestiture Assets.
If the trustee has not accomplished the divestitures ordered under this Final Judgment within six (6) months after its appointment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestitures, (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestitures have not been accomplished, and (3) the trustee's recommendations. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the United States, which shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VI. Landlord Consent
If AMC is unable to effect the divestitures required herein due to the inability to obtain the Landlord Consent for any of the Divestiture Assets, AMC shall divest alternative theatre assets that compete effectively with the theatres for which the Landlord Consent was not obtained. The United States shall, in its sole discretion (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) determine whether such theatre assets compete effectively with the theatres for which landlord consent was not obtained.
Within five (5) business days following a determination that Landlord Consent cannot be obtained for the Divestiture Assets, AMC shall notify the United States and propose an alternative divestiture pursuant to Section VI(A). The United States shall have then ten (10) business days in which to determine whether such theatre assets are a suitable alternative pursuant to Section VI(A). If AMC's selection is deemed not to be a suitable alternative, the United States shall in its sole discretion select the theatre assets to be divested (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate).
If the trustee is responsible for effecting the divestitures, it shall notify both the United States and AMC within five (5) business days following a determination that Landlord Consent cannot be obtained for the Divestiture Assets. AMC shall thereafter have five (5) business days to propose an alternative divestiture pursuant to Section VI(A). The United States shall have then ten (10) business days in which to determine whether such theatre assets are suitable alternative pursuant to Section VI(A). If AMC's selection is deemed not to be a suitable competitive alternative, the United States shall in its sole discretion select the theatre assets to be divested (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate).
VII. Notice of Proposed Divestitures
Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, AMC or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestitures required herein, shall notify the United States (and, as appropriate, the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana), of any proposed divestitures required by Sections IV or V of this Final Judgment. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify Defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestitures and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered or expressed an interest in or desire to acquire any ownership interest in the Divestiture Assets, together with full details of the same.
Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the United States (the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana) of such notice, the United States may request from Defendants, the proposed Acquirer(s), any other third party, or the trustee, if applicable, additional information concerning the proposed divestitures, the proposed Acquirer(s), and any other potential Acquirer(s). Defendants and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after the United States has been provided the additional information requested from Defendants, the proposed Acquirer(s), any third party, and the trustee, whichever is later, the United States shall provide written notice to Defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestitures. If the United States provides written notice that it does not object, the divestitures may be consummated, subject only to Defendants' limited right to object to the sale under Section V(C) of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed Acquirer(s) or upon objection by the United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or Section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by Defendants under Section V(C), a divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VIII. Financing
Defendants shall not finance all or any part of any purchase made pursuant to Section IV or V of this Final Judgment.
IX. Hold Separate
Until the divestitures required by this Final Judgment have been accomplished, Defendants shall take all steps necessary to comply with the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered by this Court. Defendants shall take no action that would jeopardize the divestitures ordered by this Court.
X. Affidavits
Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, and every thirty (30) calendar days thereafter until the divestitures have been completed under Sections IV or V, AMC shall deliver to the United States an affidavit as to the fact and manner of its compliance with Sections IV or V of this Final Judgment. Each such affidavit shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding thirty (30) calendar days, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts AMC has taken to solicit buyers for the Divestiture Assets, and to provide required information to prospective purchasers, including the limitations, if any, on such information. Assuming the information set forth in the affidavit is true and complete, any objection by the United States to information provided by AMC, including limitation on information, shall be made within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such affidavit.
Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, AMC shall deliver to the United States an affidavit that describes in reasonable detail all actions Defendants have taken and all steps Defendants have implemented on an ongoing basis to comply with Section IX of this Final Judgment. AMC shall deliver to the United States an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in AMC's earlier affidavits filed pursuant to this section within fifteen (15) calendar days after the change is implemented.
Defendants shall keep all records of all efforts made to preserve and divest the Divestiture Assets until one year after such divestitures have been completed.
XI. Compliance Inspection
For the purposes of determining or securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or of determining whether the Final Judgment should be modified or vacated, and subject to any legally recognized privilege, from time to time duly authorized representatives of the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division (""DOJ""), including consultants and other persons retained by the United States, shall, upon written request of an authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, and on reasonable notice to Defendants, be permitted:
access during Defendants' office hours to inspect and copy, or at plaintiffs' option, to require Defendants to provide hard copy or electronic copies of, all books, ledgers, accounts, records, data, and documents in the possession, custody, or control of Defendants, relating to any matters contained in this Final Judgment; and
to interview, either informally or on the record, Defendants' officers, employees, or agents, who may have their individual counsel present, regarding such matters. The interviews shall be subject to the reasonable convenience of the interviewee and without restraint or interference by Defendants.
Upon the written request of an authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, Defendants shall submit written reports or response to written interrogatories, under oath if requested, relating to any of the matters contained in this Final Judgment as may be requested.
No information or documents obtained by the means provided in this section shall be divulged by the United States to any person other than an authorized representative of the executive branch of the United States, except in the course of legal proceedings to which the United States is a party (including grand jury proceedings), or for the purpose of securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or as otherwise required by law.
If at the time information or documents are furnished by Defendants to the United States, Defendants represent and identify in writing the material in any such information or documents to which a claim of protection may be asserted under Rule 26(c)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Defendants mark each pertinent page of such material, ""Subject to claim of protection under Rule 26(c)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,"" then the plaintiffs shall give Defendants ten (10) calendar days notice prior to divulging such material in any legal proceeding (other than a grand jury proceeding).
XII. Notification
Unless such transaction is otherwise subject to the reporting and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18a (the ""HSR Act""), AMC, without providing advance notification to the DOJ, shall not directly or indirectly acquire any assets of or any interest, including any financial, security, loan, equity or management interest, in the business of theatres exhibiting first-run, commercial movies in Cook County, Illinois; Dupage County, Illinois; Adams County, Colorado; Boulder County, Colorado; Jefferson County, Colorado; Marion County, Indiana; and Johnson County, Indiana during a ten year period.
Unless such transaction is otherwise subject to the reporting and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18a (the ""HSR Act""), Kerasotes, without providing advance notification to the DOJ, shall not directly or indirectly acquire any assets of or any interest, including any financial, security, loan, or equity interest, in the business of theatres exhibiting first-run, commercial movies in Cook County, Illinois during a ten year period. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event shall Kerasotes be required to provide advance notification under this provision of any of the following activities: (i) engaging in a sale/leaseback, developer-financed or similar transaction, or developing internally using its own or third-party financing, in each case with respect to a newly-developed theatre; or (ii) making an acquisition of not more than two percent of the outstanding voting securities of a publicly-traded company with theatres exhibiting first-run, commercial movies where such investment is made ""solely for the purpose of investment"" as that term is construed under 15 U.S.C. ยง 802.9.

III. Applicability
This Final Judgment applies to AMC and Kerasotes, as defined above, and all other persons in active concert or participation with any of them who receive actual notice of this Final Judgment by personal service or otherwise.
If, prior to complying with Sections IV and V of this Final Judgment, Defendants sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets or of lesser business units that include the Divestiture Assets, they shall require the purchaser to be bound by the provisions of this Final Judgment. Defendants need not obtain such an agreement from the acquirers of the assets divested pursuant to this Final Judgment.
IV. Divestitures
AMC is ordered and directed, within sixty (60) calendar days after the filing of the Complaint in this matter, or five (5) calendar days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to divest the Divestiture Assets in a manner consistent with this Final Judgment to one or more Acquirer(s) acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate). The United States, in its sole discretion, may agree to one or more extensions of this time period, and shall notify the Court in such circumstances. AMC agrees to use its best efforts to divest the Divestiture Assets as expeditiously as possible.
In accomplishing the divestitures ordered by this Final Judgment, AMC promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of the Divestiture Assets. AMC shall inform any person making inquiry regarding a possible purchase of the Divestiture Assets that they are being divested pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide that person with a copy of this Final Judgment. AMC shall offer to furnish to all prospective Acquirers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information and documents relating to the Divestiture Assets customarily provided in a due diligence process except such information or documents subject to the attorney-client privilege or work-product doctrine. AMC shall make available such information to the Plaintiffs at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
AMC shall provide the Acquirer(s) and the United States information relating to the personnel involved in the operation of the Divestiture Assets to enable the Acquirer(s) to make offers of employment. Defendants will not interfere with any negotiations by the Acquirer(s) to employ any Defendant employee whose primary responsibility is the operation of the Divestiture Assets.
AMC shall permit prospective Acquirer(s) of the Divestiture Assets to have reasonable access to personnel and to make inspections of the physical facilities of the Divestiture Assets; access to any and all environmental, zoning, and other permit documents and information; and access to any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.
AMC shall warrant to Acquirer(s) of the Divestiture Assets that each asset will be operational on the date of sale.
Defendants shall not take any action that will impede in any way the permitting, operation, or divestitures of the Divestiture Assets. At the option of the Acquirer(s), AMC shall enter into an agreement for products and services, such as computer support services, that are reasonably necessary for the Acquirer(s) to effectively operate the Divestiture Assets during a transition period. The terms and conditions of any contractual arrangements meant to satisfy this provision must be commercially reasonable for those products and services for which the agreement is entered and shall remain in effect for no more than three months, absent approval of the United States, in its sole discretion (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate).
AMC shall warrant to the Acquirer(s) that there are no material defects in the environmental, zoning, or other permits pertaining to the operation of each asset. Following the sale of the Divestiture Assets, Defendants will not undertake, directly or indirectly, any challenges to the environmental, zoning, or other permits relating to the operation of the Divestiture Assets.
Unless the United States (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) otherwise consents in writing, the divestitures made pursuant to Section IV, or by trustee appointed pursuant to Section V of this Final Judgment, shall include the entire Divestiture Assets, and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) that the Divestiture Assets can and will be used by the Acquirer(s) as part of a viable, ongoing business of operating mainstream theatres that exhibit first-run, commercial movies. Divestitures of the Divestiture Assets may be made to one or more Acquirers, provided that in each instance it is demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of the United States (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) that the Divestiture Assets will remain viable and the divestitures of such assets will remedy the competitive harm alleged in the Complaint. The divestitures, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V of this Final Judgment,
shall be made to Acquirers that, in the United States' sole judgment (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) have the intent and capability (including the necessary managerial, operational, technical, and financial capability) of competing effectively in the business of mainstream theatres exhibiting first-run, commercial movies; and
shall be accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) that none of the terms of any agreement between Acquirers and Defendants give the ability unreasonably to raise the Acquirers' costs, to lower the Acquirers' efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the Acquirers to compete effectively.
V. Appointment of Trustee
If AMC has not divested the Divestiture Assets within the time period specified in Section IV(A), AMC shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestitures of the Divestiture Assets.
After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the Divestiture Assets. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestitures to Acquirer(s) acceptable to the United States (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, VI, and VII of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court deems appropriate. Subject to Section V(D) of this Final Judgment, the trustee may hire at the cost and expense of AMC any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents, who shall be solely accountable to the trustee, reasonably necessary in the trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture.
Defendants shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by Defendants must be conveyed in writing to the United States and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VII.
The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of AMC, on such terms and conditions as the United States approves, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to AMC and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of the trustee and any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the Divestiture Assets and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestitures and the speed with which it is accomplished, but timeliness is paramount.
Defendants shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestitures. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the business to be divested, and Defendants shall develop financial and other information relevant to such business as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to reasonable protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestitures.
After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the parties and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestitures ordered under this Final Judgment. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the Divestiture Assets.
If the trustee has not accomplished the divestitures ordered under this Final Judgment within six (6) months after its appointment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestitures, (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestitures have not been accomplished, and (3) the trustee's recommendations. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the United States, which shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VI. Landlord Consent
If AMC is unable to effect the divestitures required herein due to the inability to obtain the Landlord Consent for any of the Divestiture Assets, AMC shall divest alternative theatre assets that compete effectively with the theatres for which the Landlord Consent was not obtained. The United States shall, in its sole discretion (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate) determine whether such theatre assets compete effectively with the theatres for which landlord consent was not obtained.
Within five (5) business days following a determination that Landlord Consent cannot be obtained for the Divestiture Assets, AMC shall notify the United States and propose an alternative divestiture pursuant to Section VI(A). The United States shall have then ten (10) business days in which to determine whether such theatre assets are a suitable alternative pursuant to Section VI(A). If AMC's selection is deemed not to be a suitable alternative, the United States shall in its sole discretion select the theatre assets to be divested (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate).
If the trustee is responsible for effecting the divestitures, it shall notify both the United States and AMC within five (5) business days following a determination that Landlord Consent cannot be obtained for the Divestiture Assets. AMC shall thereafter have five (5) business days to propose an alternative divestiture pursuant to Section VI(A). The United States shall have then ten (10) business days in which to determine whether such theatre assets are suitable alternative pursuant to Section VI(A). If AMC's selection is deemed not to be a suitable competitive alternative, the United States shall in its sole discretion select the theatre assets to be divested (after consultation with the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana, as appropriate).
VII. Notice of Proposed Divestitures
Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, AMC or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestitures required herein, shall notify the United States (and, as appropriate, the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana), of any proposed divestitures required by Sections IV or V of this Final Judgment. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify Defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestitures and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered or expressed an interest in or desire to acquire any ownership interest in the Divestiture Assets, together with full details of the same.
Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the United States (the State of Illinois, the State of Colorado, and the State of Indiana) of such notice, the United States may request from Defendants, the proposed Acquirer(s), any other third party, or the trustee, if applicable, additional information concerning the proposed divestitures, the proposed Acquirer(s), and any other potential Acquirer(s). Defendants and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after the United States has been provided the additional information requested from Defendants, the proposed Acquirer(s), any third party, and the trustee, whichever is later, the United States shall provide written notice to Defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestitures. If the United States provides written notice that it does not object, the divestitures may be consummated, subject only to Defendants' limited right to object to the sale under Section V(C) of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed Acquirer(s) or upon objection by the United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or Section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by Defendants under Section V(C), a divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VIII. Financing
Defendants shall not finance all or any part of any purchase made pursuant to Section IV or V of this Final Judgment.
IX. Hold Separate
Until the divestitures required by this Final Judgment have been accomplished, Defendants shall take all steps necessary to comply with the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered by this Court. Defendants shall take no action that would jeopardize the divestitures ordered by this Court.
X. Affidavits
Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, and every thirty (30) calendar days thereafter until the divestitures have been completed under Sections IV or V, AMC shall deliver to the United States an affidavit as to the fact and manner of its compliance with Sections IV or V of this Final Judgment. Each such affidavit shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding thirty (30) calendar days, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts AMC has taken to solicit buyers for the Divestiture Assets, and to provide required information to prospective purchasers, including the limitations, if any, on such information. Assuming the information set forth in the affidavit is true and complete, any objection by the United States to information provided by AMC, including limitation on information, shall be made within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such affidavit.
Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, AMC shall deliver to the United States an affidavit that describes in reasonable detail all actions Defendants have taken and all steps Defendants have implemented on an ongoing basis to comply with Section IX of this Final Judgment. AMC shall deliver to the United States an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in AMC's earlier affidavits filed pursuant to this section within fifteen (15) calendar days after the change is implemented.
Defendants shall keep all records of all efforts made to preserve and divest the Divestiture Assets until one year after such divestitures have been completed.
XI. Compliance Inspection
For the purposes of determining or securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or of determining whether the Final Judgment should be modified or vacated, and subject to any legally recognized privilege, from time to time duly authorized representatives of the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division (""DOJ""), including consultants and other persons retained by the United States, shall, upon written request of an authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, and on reasonable notice to Defendants, be permitted:
access during Defendants' office hours to inspect and copy, or at plaintiffs' option, to require Defendants to provide hard copy or electronic copies of, all books, ledgers, accounts, records, data, and documents in the possession, custody, or control of Defendants, relating to any matters contained in this Final Judgment; and
to interview, either informally or on the record, Defendants' officers, employees, or agents, who may have their individual counsel present, regarding such matters. The interviews shall be subject to the reasonable convenience of the interviewee and without restraint or interference by Defendants.
Upon the written request of an authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, Defendants shall submit written reports or response to written interrogatories, under oath if requested, relating to any of the matters contained in this Final Judgment as may be requested.
No information or documents obtained by the means provided in this section shall be divulged by the United States to any person other than an authorized representative of the executive branch of the United States, except in the course of legal proceedings to which the United States is a party (including grand jury proceedings), or for the purpose of securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or as otherwise required by law.
If at the time information or documents are furnished by Defendants to the United States, Defendants represent and identify in writing the material in any such information or documents to which a claim of protection may be asserted under Rule 26(c)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Defendants mark each pertinent page of such material, ""Subject to claim of protection under Rule 26(c)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,"" then the plaintiffs shall give Defendants ten (10) calendar days notice prior to divulging such material in any legal proceeding (other than a grand jury proceeding).
XII. Notification

This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of and each of the parties to this action. The Complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted against defendants under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. ยง 18).
As used in this Final Judgment:
""Acquirer"" or ""Acquirers"" means the entity or entities to whom defendants divest the Theatre Assets.
""AMC"" means defendant Marquee Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri, its successors and assigns, and its subsidiaries, divisions, groups, affiliates, partnerships and joint ventures, and their directors, officers, managers, agents, and employees.
""Loews"" means defendant LCE Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in New York City, New York, its successors and assigns, and its subsidiaries, divisions, groups, affiliates, partnerships and joint ventures, and their directors, officers, managers, agents, and employees.
""Landlord Consent"" means any contractual approval or consent that the landlord or owner of one or more of the Theatre Assets, or the property on which one or more of the Theatre Assets is situated, must grant prior to the transfer of one of the Theatre Assets to an Acquirer.
""Theatre Assets"" means the first-run, commercial motion picture theatre businesses operated by AMC or Loews, under the following names and at the following locations:
  Theatre Name Theatre Address
i. City North 14 2600 N. Western Ave. Chicago, IL
ii. Webster Place 11 1471 W. Webster Avenue Chicago, IL
iii. E-Walk 13 247 W. 42nd St. New York, NY
iv. Meridian 16 1501 7th Ave. Seattle, WA

The term ""Theatre Assets"" includes:
1. All tangible assets that comprise the first-run, commercial motion picture theatre business including all equipment, fixed assets and fixtures, personal property, inventory, office furniture, materials, supplies, and other tangible property and all assets used in connection with the Theatre Assets; all licenses, permits and authorizations issued by any governmental organization relating to the Theatre Assets; all contracts, agreements, leases, commitments, certifications, and understandings, relating to the Theatre Assets, including supply agreements; all customer lists, contracts, accounts, and credit records; all repair and performance records and all other records relating to the Theatre Assets;
2. All intangible assets used in the development, production, servicing and sale of Theatre Assets, including, but not limited to all licenses and sublicenses, intellectual property, technical information, computer software (except defendants' proprietary software) and related documentation, know-how, drawings, blueprints, designs, specifications for materials, specifications for parts and devices, quality assurance and control procedures, all technical manuals and information defendants provide to their own employees, customers, suppliers, agents or licensees, and all research data relating to the Theatre Assets. Provided however, that this term does not include (a) any right to use or interest in defendants' copyrights, trademarks, trade names, service marks or service names, or (b) assets that the defendants do not own and are not legally able to transfer.
III. Applicability
A. This Final Judgment applies to AMC and Loews, as defined above, and all other persons in active concert or participation with any of them who receive actual notice of this Final Judgment by personal service or otherwise.
B. Defendants shall require, as a condition of the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of their assets or of lesser business units that include the Theatre Assets, that the purchaser agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Final Judgment, provided, however, that defendants need not obtain such an agreement from the Acquirer[s],
IV. Divestitures
A. Defendants are ordered and directed, within 120 calendar days after the filing of the Complaint in this matter, or five (5) days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to divest the Theatre Assets in a manner consistent with this Final Judgment to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion after consultation with the State of Illinois, State of New York, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as appropriate. The United States, in its sole discretion, may agree to one or more extensions of this time period not to exceed 60 days in total, and shall notify the Court in such circumstances. Defendants agree to use their best efforts to divest the Theatre Assets as expeditiously as possible.
B. In accomplishing the divestiture[s] ordered by this Final Judgment, defendants promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of the Theatre Assets. Defendants shall inform any person making inquiry regarding a possible purchase of the Theatre Assets that they are being divested pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide that person with a copy of this Final Judgment. Defendants shall offer to furnish to all prospective Acquirers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information and documents relating to the Theatre Assets customarily provided in a due diligence process except such information or documents subject to the attorney-client or work-product privileges. Defendants shall make available such information to the United States at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
C. Defendants shall provide the Acquirer[s] and the United States information relating to the personnel involved in the operation of the Theatre Assets to enable the Acquirer[s] to make offers of employment. Defendants will not interfere with any negotiations by the Acquirer[s] to employ any defendant employee whose primary responsibility is the operation of the Theatre Assets.
D. Defendants shall permit prospective Acquirers of the Theatre Assets to have reasonable access to personnel and to make inspections of the physical facilities of the Theatre Assets; access to any and all environmental, zoning, and other permit documents and information; and access to any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.
E. Defendants shall warrant to all Acquirers of the Theatre Assets that each asset will be operational on the date of sale.
F. Defendants shall not take any action that will impede in any way the permitting, operation, or divestiture[s] of the Theatre Assets.
G. At the option of the Acquirer[s], defendants shall enter into an agreement for products and services, such as computer support services, that are reasonably necessary for the Acquirer[s] to effectively operate the Theatre Assets during a transition period. The terms and conditions of any contractual arrangements meant to satisfy this provision must be commercially reasonable for those products and services for which the agreement is entered and shall remain in effect for no more than three months, absent approval of the United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with the State of Illinois, State of New York, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as appropriate.
H. Defendants shall warrant to the Acquirer[s] of the Theatre Assets that there are no material defects in the environmental, zoning or other permits pertaining to the operation of each asset, and that following the sale of the Theatre Assets, defendants will not undertake, directly or indirectly, any challenges to the environmental, zoning, or other permits relating to the operation of the Theatre Assets.
I. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, the divestiture[s] pursuant to Section IV, or by trustee appointed pursuant to Section V, of this Final Judgment, shall include the entire Theatre Assets, and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion (after consultation with the State of Illinois, State of New York, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as appropriate) that the Theatre Assets can and will be used by the Acquirer[s] as part of a viable, ongoing business of first-run, commercial motion picture theatres. Divestiture[s] of the Theatre Assets may be made to one or more Acquirers, provided that in each instance it is demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of the United States that the Theatre Assets will remain viable and the divestiture[s] of such assets will remedy the competitive harm alleged in the Complaint. The divestiture[s], whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V of this Final Judgment,
shall be made to an Acquirer (or Acquirers) that, in the United States's sole judgment (after consultation with the State of Illinois, State of New York, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as appropriate), has the intent and capability (including the necessary managerial, operational, technical and financial capability) of competing effectively in the business of first-run, commercial motion picture theatres; and
shall be accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion (after consultation with the State of Illinois, State of New York, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as appropriate), that none of the terms of any agreement between an Acquirer (or Acquirers) and defendants give defendants the ability unreasonably to raise the Acquirer's costs, to lower the Acquirer's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the Acquirer to compete effectively.
V. Appointment of Trustee
A. If defendants have not divested the Theatre Assets within the time period specified in Section IV(A), defendants shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestiture[s] of the Theatre Assets.
B. After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the Theatre Assets. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture[s] to an Acquirer[s] acceptable to the United States (after consultation with the State of Illinois, State of New York, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as appropriate) at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, VI, and VII of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court deems appropriate. Subject to Section V (D) of this Final Judgment, the trustee may hire at the cost and expense of defendants any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents, who shall be solely accountable to the trustee, reasonably necessary in the trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture[s].
C. Defendants shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by defendants must be conveyed in writing to the United States and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VII.
D. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of defendants, on such terms and conditions as the Court approves, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to defendants and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of the trustee and any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the Theatre Assets and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture[s] and the speed with which it is accomplished, but timeliness is paramount.
E. Defendants shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture[s]. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the business to be divested, and defendants shall develop financial and other information relevant to such business as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to reasonable protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture[s].
F. After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the parties and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestiture[s] ordered under this Final Judgment. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Theatre Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the Theatre Assets.
G. If the trustee has not accomplished such divestiture[s] within six months after its appointment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture[s], (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestiture[s] has not been accomplished, and (3) the trustee's recommendations. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the United States and, as appropriate, the State of Illinois, State of New York, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts who shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VI. Landlord Consent
A. If defendants are unable to effect the divestiture[s] required herein due to the inability to obtain the Landlord Consent for any of the Theatre Assets, defendants shall divest alternative Theatre Assets that compete effectively with the theatre for which Landlord Consent was not obtained. The United States shall in its sole discretion (after consultation with the State of Illinois, State of New York, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as appropriate), determine whether such theatre competes effectively with the theatre for which landlord consent was not obtained.
B. Within five (5) business days following a determination that Landlord Consent cannot be obtained for one of the Theatre Assets, defendants shall notify the United States and propose an alternative divestiture pursuant to Section VI(A). The United States shall have then ten (10) business days in which to determine whether such theatre is a suitable alternative pursuant to Section VI(A). If the defendants' selection is deemed not to be a suitable alternative, the United States shall in its sole discretion select the theatre to be divested (after consultation with the State of Illinois, State of New York, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as appropriate).
C. If the trustee is responsible for effecting the divestiture[s], it shall notify both the United States and the defendants within five (5) business days following a determination that Landlord Consent can not be obtained for one of the Theatre Assets. Defendants shall thereafter have five (5) business days to propose an alternative divestiture pursuant to Section VI(a). The United States shall have then ten (10) business days in which to determine whether such theatre is suitable alternative pursuant to Section Vl(a). If the defendants' selection is deemed not to be a suitable competitive alternative, the United States shall in its sole discretion select the theatre to be divested (after consultation with the State of Illinois, State of New York, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as appropriate).
VII. Notice of Proposed Divestitures
A. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, defendants or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture[s] required herein, shall notify the United States and, as appropriate, the State of Illinois, State of New York, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts of any proposed divestiture[s] required by Sections IV or V of this Final Judgment. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestiture[s] and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered or expressed an interest in or desire to acquire any ownership interest in the Theatre Assets, together with full details of the same.
B. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the United States of such notice, the United States may request from defendants, the proposed Acquirer or Acquirers, any other third party, or the trustee if applicable additional information concerning the proposed divestiture[s], the proposed Acquirer or Acquirers, and any other potential Acquirer. Defendants and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
C. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after the United States has been provided the additional information requested from defendants, the proposed Acquirer or Acquirers, any third party, and the trustee, whichever is later, the United States shall provide written notice to defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture[s]. If the United States provides written notice that it does not object, the divestiture[s] may be consummated, subject only to defendants' limited right to object to the sale under Section V(C) of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed Acquirer[s] or upon objection by the United States, the divestiture[s] proposed under Sections IV or Section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by defendants under Section V(C), the divestiture[s] proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VIII. Financing
Defendants shall not finance all or any part of any purchase made pursuant to Section IV or V of this Final Judgment.
IX. Hold Separate
Until the divestiture[s] required by this Final Judgment has been accomplished defendants shall take all steps necessary to comply with the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered by this Court. Defendants shall take no action that would jeopardize the divestiture[s] ordered by this Court.
X. Affidavits
A. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, and every thirty (30) calendar days thereafter until the divestiture[s] has/have been completed under Sections IV or V, defendants shall deliver to the United States an affidavit as to the fact and manner of its compliance with Section IV or V of this Final Judgment. Each such affidavit shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding thirty days, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Theatre Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts defendants have taken to solicit buyers for the Theatre Assets, and to provide required information to prospective purchasers, including the limitations, if any, on such information. Assuming the information set forth in the affidavit is true and complete, any objection by the United States to information provided by defendants, including limitation on information, shall be made within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such affidavit.
B. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, defendants shall deliver to the United States an affidavit that describes in reasonable detail all actions defendants have taken and all steps defendants have implemented on an ongoing basis to comply with Section DC of this Final Judgment. Defendants shall deliver to the United States an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in defendants' earlier affidavits filed pursuant to this section within fifteen (15) calendar days after the change is implemented.
C. Defendants shall keep all records of all efforts made to preserve and divest the Theatre Assets until one year after such divestiture[s] has/have been completed.
XI. Compliance Inspection
A. For the purposes of determining or securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or of determining whether the Final Judgment should be modified or vacated, and subject to any legally recognized privilege, from time to time duly authorized representatives of the United States Department of Justice, the State of Illinois, State of New York, or Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including consultants and other persons retained by either of them, shall, upon written request of a duly authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, the Attorney General for Illinois, Attorney General for New York, or Attorney General for Massachusetts, and on reasonable notice to defendants, be permitted:
access during defendants' office hours to inspect and copy, or at plaintiffs option, to require defendants provide copies of, all books, ledgers, accounts, records and documents in the possession, custody, or control of defendants, relating to any matters contained in this Final Judgment; and
to interview, either informally or on the record, defendants' officers, employees, or agents, who may have their individual counsel present, regarding such matters. The interviews shall be subject to the reasonable convenience of the interviewee and without restraint or interference by defendants.
B. Upon the written request of a duly authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, the Attorney General for Illinois, Attorney General for New York, or Attorney General for Massachusetts, defendants shall submit written reports, under oath if requested, relating to any of the matters contained in this Final Judgment as may be requested
C. No information or documents obtained by the means provided in this section shall be divulged by the United States, the State of Illinois, State of New York, or Commonwealth of Massachusetts, to any person other than an authorized representative of the executive branch of the United States, or of each state government, except in the course of legal proceedings to which at least one of the plaintiffs is a party (including grand jury proceedings), or for the purpose of securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or as otherwise required by law.
D. If at the time information or documents are furnished by defendants to the plaintiffs, defendants represent and identify in writing the material in any such information or documents to which a claim of protection may be asserted under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and defendants mark each pertinent page of such material, ""Subject to claim of protection under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,"" then the plaintiffs shall give defendants ten (10) calendar days notice prior to divulging such material in any legal proceeding (other than a grand jury proceeding).
XII. Notification
Unless such transaction is otherwise subject to the reporting and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18a (the ""HSR Act""), defendants, without providing advance notification to the United States, shall not directly or indirectly acquire any assets of or any interest, including any financial, security, loan, equity or management interest, in the business of first-run, commercial theatres in Cook County, Illinois; New York County, New York (Manhattan); King County, Washington; Suffolk County, Massachusetts; and Dallas County, Texas during a 10-year period. This notification requirement shall apply only to the acquisition of any assets or any interest in the business of first-run, commercial motion picture theatres at the time of the acquisition and shall not be construed to require notification of acquisition of interest in new theatre developments or of assets not being operated as first-run commercial motion picture theatre businesses, provided, that this notification requirement shall apply to first-run, commercial theatres under construction at the time of the entering of this Final Judgment.
Such notification shall be provided to the United States in the same format as, and per the instructions relating to the Notification and Report Form set forth in the Appendix to Part 803 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations as amended, except that the information requested in Items 5 through 9 of the instructions must be provided only about first-run, commercial theatres.

If within the 30-day period after notification, representatives of United States make a written request for additional information, defendants shall not consummate the proposed transaction or agreement until twenty (20) days after submitting all such additional information. Early termination of the waiting periods in this paragraph may be requested and, where appropriate, granted in the same manner as is applicable under the requirements and provisions of the HSR Act and rules promulgated thereunder.

Civil Action No. 95-1211 (RCL)
Judge Royce C. Lamberth


PETITION BY THE UNITED STATES FOR AN ORDER
TO SHOW CAUSE WHY DEFENDANT AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION
SHOULD NOT BE FOUND IN CIVIL CONTEMPT
The United States of America, by its attorneys, acting under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States, presents this Petition for an order requiring Defendant, the American Bar Association, to show cause why it should not be found in civil contempt for multiple violations of the Final Judgment entered in this action in 1996 and modified in 2001. The United States represents as follows:
I.
THE DEFENDANT
1. Defendant American Bar Association (the ""ABA"") is a national association for lawyers and the world's largest professional association. It is a voluntary membership organization structured as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation with its principal place of business in Chicago.
II.
JURISDICTION OF THE COURT
2. This Court has jurisdiction under its inherent power to enforce its orders. In addition, Section XI of the Final Judgment provides:
Jurisdiction is retained by this Court for the purpose of enabling either of the parties to this Final Judgment to apply to this Court at any time for further orders and directions as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out or construe this Final Judgment, to modify or terminate any of its provisions, to enforce compliance, and to punish violations of its provisions.
III.
BACKGROUND
3. The ABA's Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar (the ""Council"") is recognized by the United States Department of Education to accredit programs that lead to the first professional degree in law. The Council is the only national accrediting body for law schools. Every jurisdiction in the United States permits graduates of ABA-accredited law schools to sit for the bar exam, and most jurisdictions require those sitting for their bar exams to have graduated from ABA-accredited law schools.
4. The ABA promulgates Standards for the Approval of Law Schools (the ""Standards"") which set forth requirements for accreditation. In addition, the ABA promulgates Interpretations, which illustrate how the Standards are to be applied, and Rules of Procedure, which govern proceedings in which the Standards are applied.
5. The ABA's Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar (the ""Section"") administers law school accreditation. The Council governs the Section and has supervisory authority on all accreditation matters. The Section's Standards Review Committee considers revisions to the Standards and Interpretations and recommends such changes to the Council. Applying the Standards, the Accreditation Committee determines whether law schools merit accreditation and periodically reviews their accreditation status. Decisions of the Accreditation Committee may be appealed to the Council. The Council has ultimate authority over proposed revisions to the Standards, Interpretations and Rules of Procedure and over appeals from the Accreditation Committee.
6. On June 27, 1995, the United States filed this civil action, alleging that the ABA's accreditation activities violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1. The Complaint alleged that the ABA had allowed the accreditation process to be misused for anticompetitive purposes by law school personnel with direct economic interests in the outcomes. The Complaint further alleged, inter alia, that the ABA fixed faculty salaries and compensation; boycotted state-accredited law schools by prohibiting ABA-approved schools from accepting transfer credits from state-accredited schools or enrolling the graduates of such schools in post-J.D. programs; and boycotted for-profit law schools.
7. On June 25, 1996, the Court entered an agreed-upon Final Judgment requiring the ABA to reform its law-school accreditation processes substantially. A copy of the Final Judgment is attached as Exhibit 1. Section IV of the Final Judgment prohibits the ABA from fixing salaries or sharing information about the compensation of law school employees and from boycotting state-accredited and for-profit law schools. Section VI requires structural changes in the ABA's accreditation process, including limits on the composition of the Standards Review and Accreditation Committees and the establishment of various reporting requirements. Section VIII requires the ABA to maintain an antitrust and consent decree compliance program and to designate an Antitrust Compliance Officer to be responsible for various specified activities. Section IX requires the ABA, inter alia, to certify annually that it has complied with the provisions of Section VIII. Section X permits the Department of Justice to inspect records and conduct interviews to determine and secure compliance with the Final Judgment.
8. Certain provisions in the Final Judgment reflected that the House of Delegates possessed the ultimate authority within the ABA concerning accreditation when the Final Judgment was entered by this Court. Subsequently, the Department of Education determined that this arrangement did not conform to statutory and regulatory requirements. See 20 U.S.C. ยง 1099(b) (1998) and 34 C.F.R. ยง 602.3 (1999). The ABA then sought modification of Sections VI and VIII of the Final Judgment to permit the House of Delegates only to review the Council's accreditation decisions and revisions to the Standards, Interpretations and Rules of Procedure and remand them for further proceedings, leaving ultimate authority with the Council. The Department of Justice consented to the proposed modifications. On February 6, 2001, the Court entered the agreed-upon Modification Of Final Judgment, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 2.
9. The structural provisions in Sections VI and VIII of the Final Judgment ensure that the law school accreditation process is governed by persons other than those with a direct economic interest in its outcome, that the process is brought more into public view, and that the ABA complies fully with the requirements of Section IV.
IV.
VIOLATIONS OF THE FINAL JUDGMENT
10. The United States conducted a five-month investigation of the ABA's failure to comply with the Final Judgment. Through this investigation, the United States has determined that the ABA has not complied with certain provisions in Sections VI, VIII and IX of the Final Judgment, as modified.
11. Section VI(E)(3) requires that no more than half of the members of the Standards Review Committee be law school deans or faculty. In 2005-06, more than half of the members of the Standards Review Committee were law school deans or faculty, in violation of Section VI(E)(3).
12. Section VI(G)(1) requires ""that each site evaluation team include, to the extent reasonably feasible . . . one university administrator who is not a law school dean or faculty member . . . ."" Certain ABA staff responsible for forming site evaluation teams decided not to apply the requirements of Section VI(G)(1) to teams sent to law schools that are not affiliated with a university, and in multiple years did not attempt to include university administrators who were not law school deans or faculty members on such site evaluation teams, in violation of Section VI(G)(1).
13. Until 2001, Section VIII(D) of the Final Judgment required the ABA to provide the Department of Justice with ""a copy of all proposed changes to the Standards, Interpretations and Rules before they are acted on by the House of Delegates, and a copy of all Standards, Interpretations and Rules adopted by the House."" As modified in 2001, Section VIII(D) requires the ABA to provide the United States with ""a copy of all proposed changes to the Standards, Interpretations, and Rules before they are acted on by the Council, and a copy of all Standards, Interpretations and Rules adopted by the Council."" Since 1996, the ABA on multiple occasions failed to provide notices of proposed and adopted changes to the United States as required by Section VIII(D).
14. Section VIII(E) of the Final Judgment requires the ABA to give an annual briefing ""on the meaning and requirements of this Final Judgment"" to all members of the Council, Accreditation Committee and Standards Review Committee, certain ABA staff, and site evaluation workshop participants. On multiple occasions, the ABA failed to provide the briefings required by Section VIII(E).
15. Section VIII(F) of the Final Judgment mandates that the ABA obtain from all members of the Council, the Accreditation Committee and the Standards Review Committee, and certain ABA staff, an annual written certification that each person has read, understood, and agreed to abide by the terms of Final Judgment and is not aware of any violations he or she has not reported to the Antitrust Compliance Officer. On multiple occasions, the ABA failed to obtain the certifications required by Section VIII(F).
16. Section IX(B) requires that each year, on or before June 25, the ABA certify to the Court and the United States whether the ABA has complied with the provisions of Section VIII. The ABA did not certify compliance in a timely matter from 2000 through 2005.
17. Through the actions described above, the ABA on multiple occasions violated clear and unambiguous provisions of the Final Judgment and should be held in civil contempt of this Court.
18. In the course of its investigation, the United States incurred attorneys' fees and other costs.
V.
RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, the United States respectfully requests that this Court enter an Order directing the American Bar Association to appear before this Court at a time and place to be fixed in said Order, to show cause why it should not be adjudged in civil contempt of this Court, and requests the following relief:
that the American Bar Association be found in civil contempt for the violations of the Final Judgment described above;
that the American Bar Association be ordered to comply with the Final Judgment;
that the United States be awarded reasonable costs and attorneys fees incurred in investigating the American Bar Association's violations of the Final Judgment and in filing this Petition; and
such other relief as the Court may deem appropriate.

If after eighteen months from the entry of this Final Judgment, the Acquirer has failed to deliver an EOCC manufactured or reconditioned by the Acquirer to a railroad industry customer, Amsted shall also unilaterally release Progress Rail from Section 8.7 of Amsted's Asset Purchase Agreement with Progress Rail dated December 1, 2005 (""Post-Closing Non-Compete"").
E. Amsted shall preserve and maintain the Divested Assets and the assets licensed under the Supplemental Asset License and shall not license, transfer, encumber, or otherwise impair the value of such assets while the divestiture is pending.
F. Amsted shall use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the transfer of EOCC cores from Amsted's facilities at the request of railroad customers. Amsted shall take no action the effect of which is to interfere with or impede the transfer of EOCC cores owned by railroad customers to the Acquirer or the ability of the Acquirer to compete effectively in the sale of reconditioned EOCCs.
G. Amsted shall not take any action that will impede in any way the permitting, operation, or divestiture of the Divested Assets or Supplemental Asset License.
H. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, the divestiture pursuant to Section IV of this Final Judgment shall include the entire Divested Assets and Supplemental Asset License, and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that the Divested Assets and Supplemental Asset License can and will be used by the Acquirer as part of an economically viable, ongoing business engaged in the production and sale of EOCCs in the United States. The divestiture shall be accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that:
the Divestiture Assets and Supplemental Asset License will remain viable and that the divestiture will remedy the competitive harm alleged in the Complaint; and
none of the terms of any agreement between the Acquirer and Amsted gives Amsted the ability unreasonably to raise the Acquirer's costs, to lower the Acquirer's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the Acquirer to compete effectively in the production and sale of EOCCs.
V. Appointment of Trustee to Effect Divestiture
A. In the event that the Acquirer is unable or unwilling to receive the Divested Assets and Supplemental Asset License, Amsted shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestiture of the Divested Assets and the grant of the Supplemental Asset License in a manner consistent with this Final Judgment to an Alternative Acquirer approved by the United States in its sole discretion.
B. Amsted shall use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the transfer of EOCC cores from Amsted's facilities at the request of railroad customers. Amsted shall take no action the effect of which is to interfere with or impede the transfer of EOCC cores owned by railroad customers to the Alternative Acquirer or the ability of the Alternative Acquirer to compete effectively in the sale of reconditioned EOCCs.
C. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, the divestiture pursuant to Section V of this Final Judgment shall include the entire Divested Assets and Supplemental Asset License, and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that the Divested Assets and Supplemental Asset License can and will be used by the Alternative Acquirer as part of an economically viable, ongoing business engaged in the production and sale of EOCCs in the United States. The divestiture shall be accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that:
the Alternative Acquirer has the intent and capability (including the necessary managerial, operational, technical, and financial capability) to compete effectively in the production and sale of EOCCs;
none of the terms of any agreement between the Alternative Acquirer and Amsted gives Amsted the ability unreasonably to raise the Alternative Acquirer's costs, to lower the Alternative Acquirer's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the Alternative Acquirer to compete effectively in the production and sale of EOCCs; and
the Divested Assets and Supplemental Asset License will remain economically viable and the divestiture will remedy the competitive harm alleged in the Complaint.
D. After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to convey the Divested Assets and Supplemental Asset License. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture to an Alternative Acquirer approved by the United States, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, and VI of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court deems appropriate. The divestiture of the Divested Assets and the grant of the Supplemental Asset License shall be made without any cost to the Alternative Acquirer or any compensation to Amsted. Subject to Section V(E) of this Final Judgment, the trustee may hire at the cost and expense of Amsted any investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, or any other agents and outside contractors who shall be solely accountable to the trustee, reasonably necessary in the trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture.
E. Amsted shall not object to a grant or conveyance by the trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by Amsted must be in writing to the United States and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VI.
F. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of Amsted, on such terms and conditions as the United States approves, and shall account for all costs incurred from the conveyance of the Divested Assets and Supplemental Asset License. The compensation of the trustee and any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the fair market value of the Divested Assets and Supplemental Asset License, and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the speed with which the divestiture is accomplished.
G. Amsted shall use its best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities relating to the assets to be divested, and the Supplemental Asset License; and Amsted shall develop financial and other information relevant to such business as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to customary confidentiality protection. Amsted shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture.
H. After appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the United States and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestiture ordered under this Final Judgment. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divested Assets or Supplemental Asset License and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the Divested Assets or grant the Supplemental Asset License.
I. If the trustee has not accomplished such divestiture within six (6) months after its appointment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture; (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestiture has not been accomplished; and (3) the trustee's recommendations. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the United States who shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VI. Notice of Proposed Divestiture
A. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, the trustee shall notify the United States and Amsted of any proposed divestiture required by Section V of this Final Judgment. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestiture and grant of the Supplemental Asset License, and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered or expressed an interest in or desire to acquire any ownership interest in the Divested Assets or the Supplemental Asset License together with full details of the same.
B. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the United States of such notice, the United States may request from Amsted, the proposed Alternative Acquirer, any other third party, or the trustee if applicable, additional information concerning the proposed divestiture, the proposed Alternative Acquirer, and any other potential Alternative Acquirer. Amsted and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
C. Within (a) thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or (b) twenty (20) calendar days after the United States has been provided the additional information requested from Amsted, the proposed Alternative Acquirer, any third party, or the trustee, whichever is later, the United States shall provide written notice to Amsted and the trustee stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States provides written notice that it does not object, the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to Amsted's limited right to object to the conveyance under Section V(E) of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed Alternative Acquirer or upon objection by the United States, the divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by Amsted under Section V(E), the divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VII. Financing
Amsted shall not finance all or any part of any purchase or divestiture made pursuant to Section IV or V of this Final Judgment.
VIII. Hold Separate
Until the divestiture required by this Final Judgment has been accomplished, Amsted shall take all steps necessary to comply with the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered by this Court. Amsted shall take no action that would jeopardize the divestiture ordered by this Court.
IX. Affidavits
A. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, and every thirty (30) calendar days thereafter until the divestiture has been completed under Section IV or V, Amsted shall deliver to the United States an affidavit as to the fact and manner of its compliance with Section IV or V of this Final Judgment. Each such affidavit shall describe in detail each contact with any person who, during the preceding thirty (30) days, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divested Assets or Supplemental Asset License including the Acquirer or any potential Alternative Acquirer. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts Amsted has taken to convey the Divested Assets and Supplemental Asset License, and to provide required information to the Acquirer, including the limitations, if any, on such information. Assuming the information set forth in the affidavit is true and complete, any objection by the United States to information provided by Amsted, including limitations on the information, shall be made within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such affidavit.
B. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, Amsted shall deliver to the United States an affidavit that describes all actions Amsted has taken and all steps Amsted has implemented on an ongoing basis to comply with Section VIII of this Final Judgment. Amsted shall deliver to the United States an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in Amsted's earlier affidavits filed pursuant to this section within fifteen (15) calendar days after the change is implemented.
C. Amsted shall keep all records of all efforts made to preserve the Divested Assets and to convey the Divested Assets and Supplemental Asset License until one year after such divestiture has been completed.

For the purpose of determining or securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or of determining whether the Final Judgment should be modified or vacated, and subject to any legally recognized privilege, from time to time duly authorized representatives of the United States Department of Justice, including consultants and other persons retained by the United States, shall, upon written request of a duly authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, and on reasonable notice to Amsted, be permitted:

B. If, prior to complying with Section IV and VI of this Final Judgment, Defendants sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets or of lesser business units that include the Divestiture Assets, they shall require the acquirer to be bound by the provisions of this Final Judgment. Defendants need not obtain such an agreement from the Acquirer of the assets divested pursuant to this Final Judgment.
C. Defendants shall require, as a condition of the sale of the Divestiture Assets, that the Acquirer agree to be bound by Section XI of this Final Judgment.
IV. DIVESTITURES
A. Defendants are ordered and directed, within sixty (60) calendar days after the filing of the Complaint in this matter, or five (5) calendar days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to divest the Divestiture Assets in a manner consistent with this Final Judgment to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States, in its sole discretion. The United States, in its sole discretion, may agree to one or more extensions of this time period not to exceed sixty (60) calendar days in total, and shall notify the Court in such circumstances. Defendants agree to divest the Divestiture Assets as expeditiously as possible.
B. In accomplishing the divestitures ordered by this Final Judgment, Defendants promptly shall make known widely the availability of the Divestiture Assets. Defendants shall inform any person making inquiry regarding a possible purchase of the Divestiture Assets that they are being divested pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide that person with a copy of this Final Judgment. Defendants shall offer to furnish to all prospective Acquirers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information and documents relating to the Divestiture Assets customarily provided in a due diligence process, except such information or documents subject to the attorney-client privilege or work-product doctrine. Defendants shall make available such information to the United States at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
C. Defendants shall permit prospective Acquirers of the Divestiture Assets to have reasonable access to personnel and to make inspections of the physical facilities associated with the Divestiture Assets; access to any and all environmental, zoning, and other permit documents and information; and access to any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.
D. Defendants shall warrant to the Acquirer that each asset will be operational on the date of sale. Defendants shall maintain and enforce all intellectual property rights licensed to the Acquirer pursuant to the proposed Final Judgment.
E. Defendants shall not take any action that will impede in any way the permitting, operation, use, or divestiture of the Divestiture Assets.
F. Defendants shall warrant to the Acquirer that there are no material defects in the environmental, zoning or other permits pertaining to the operation of each asset, and that following the sale of the Divestiture Assets, Defendants will not undertake, directly or indirectly, any challenges to the environmental, zoning, or other permits relating to the operation of the Divestiture Assets.
G. Defendants shall take all necessary steps to accomplish the transfer of all interests the Defendants have in the HR Hughes, the Blue Ray, and any other Divestiture Asset in which the Defendants have an ownership or leasehold interest, including, but not limited to, obtaining authorization from Edison Chouest Offshore and Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC to assign Defendants' leasehold interests in the HR Hughes and the Blue Ray, respectively. Defendants agree to take all necessary steps, including paying all costs, to install the same communication, stimulation and instrumentation control software on the HR Hughes that is on the Blue Ray, or vice versa, at the preference of the Acquirer. Defendants will provide to the Acquirer copies of all manuals and training materials relating to the communication, stimulation and instrumentation control software on the HR Hughes and the Blue Ray and rights to training or service under any agreements Defendants have with third parties.
H. Except for assets discussed in IV G. above, Defendants shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary consent to assign contractual rights that are included in the Divestiture Assets, including, but not limited to, contractual rights to provide Stimulation Services, Sand Control Tools, or Stimulation Fluids for wells located in the Gulf, and contractual rights to purchase any inputs or components to those Services, Tools, or Fluids.
I. Where the Acquirer has the option to acquire specific facilities but chooses not to exercise that option:
Defendants shall bear the expense of relocating to the location of the Acquirer's choice Tangible Assets that are part of the Divestiture Assets from any of those facilities.
If the Acquirer chooses not to purchase the entire Completion Tool Technology Center of BJ (see Schedule B), Defendants shall, at the option of the Acquirer, make structural changes, at Defendants' expense, to Building E at the Completion Tool Technology Center, or to another location of the Acquirer's choosing, to enable the Acquirer to conduct testing of sand control tools. The structural changes will include the construction of up to two test cells that will be the equivalent in size, capabilities, technology, and rating of the test cells currently located at the Completion Tool Technology Center. Until the test cells are completed, and upon two business days notice, the purchaser will have the right to exclusive use, at no charge, of Building A at the Completion Tool Technology Center (in which test cells are currently located) for up to 14 days in any calendar month.
If the Acquirer chooses not to purchase BJ's Southpark facility in Lafayette, Louisiana, Defendants shall add to the Completion Tool Technology Center, or to another location of the Acquirer's choosing, a sand control laboratory equivalent to Defendant Baker Hughes' sand control laboratory at its Lafayette Supercenter.
J. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, the divestiture pursuant to Section IV, or by the trustee appointed pursuant to Section VI, of the Final Judgment, shall include all of the Divestiture Assets, and the divestiture shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that the Divestiture Assets can and will be used by the Acquirer as part of a viable, ongoing business engaged in the design, development, production, marketing, servicing, distribution, and sale of the Stimulation Services, Sand Control Tools, and Stimulation Fluids for wells located in the Gulf, and that such divestiture will remedy the competitive harm alleged in the Complaint. The divestiture, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section VI of this Final Judgment:
shall be made to an Acquirer that, in the United States' sole judgment, has the intent and capability (including the necessary managerial, operational, technical and financial capability) of competing effectively as a supplier of Stimulation Services, Sand Control Tools, and Stimulation Fluids for customers in the Gulf; and
shall be accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that none of the terms of any agreement between the Acquirer and Defendants give Defendants the ability unreasonably to raise the Acquirer's costs, to lower the Acquirer's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the Acquirer to compete effectively.
V. RIGHT TO HIRE
A. To enable the Acquirer to make offers of employment, Defendants shall provide the Acquirer and the United States with organization charts and information relating to Relevant Employees, including name, job title, responsibilities as of March 1, 2010, training and educational history, relevant certifications, and, to the extent permissible by law, job performance evaluations, and current salary and benefits information.
B. Upon request, Defendants shall make Relevant Employees available for interviews with the Acquirer during normal business hours at a mutually agreeable location and will not interfere with any negotiations by the Acquirer to employ Relevant Employees. Interference with respect to this paragraph includes, but is not limited to, offering to increase the salary or benefits of Relevant Employees other than as a part of a company-wide increase in salary or benefits granted in the ordinary course of business.
C. For Relevant Employees who elect employment by the Acquirer, Defendants shall waive all noncompete agreements and all nondisclosure agreements, except as specified in V D. below, vest all unvested pension and other equity rights, and provide all benefits to which the Relevant Employees would generally be provided if transferred to a buyer of an ongoing business.
D. Nothing in this Section shall prohibit Defendants from maintaining any reasonable restrictions on the disclosure by an employee who accepts an offer of employment with the Acquirer of the Defendants' proprietary non-public information that is (1) not otherwise required to be disclosed by this Final Judgment, (2) related solely to the Defendants' businesses and clients, and (3) unrelated to the Divestiture Assets.
VI. APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE
A. If Defendants have not divested the Divestiture Assets within the time period specified in Section IVA. of this Final Judgment, Defendants shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestiture of the Divestiture Assets.
B. After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the Divestiture Assets. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, and VI of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court deems appropriate. Subject to Section VI D. of this Final Judgment, the trustee may hire at the cost and expense of Defendants any investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other agents, who shall be solely accountable to the trustee, reasonably necessary in the trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture.
C. Defendants shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by Defendants must be conveyed in writing to the United States and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VII.
D. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of Defendants, on such terms and conditions as the United States approves. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After payment of fees for the trustee's services and those of investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other agents retained by it, all remaining money shall be paid to Defendants. After the trustee submits its final report, including the final accounting, to the court, the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of the trustee and any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the Divestiture Assets and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished, but timeliness is paramount. Defendants shall expeditiously reach agreement with the trustee on the trustee's fee arrangement.
E. Defendants shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestitures. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the Divestiture Assets, and Defendants shall develop financial and other information relevant to the Divestiture Assets as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to reasonable protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with, delay, or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestitures.
F. After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the United States setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestitures ordered under this Final Judgment. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the Divestiture Assets.
G. If the trustee has not accomplished the divestitures ordered under this Final Judgment within six (6) months after his or her appointment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth: (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestitures; (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestitures have not been accomplished; and (3) the trustee's recommendations. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the United States, which shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VII. NOTICE OF PROPOSED DIVESTITURE
A. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, Defendants shall notify the United States of any proposed divestiture required by Section IV of this Final Judgment. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, the trustee shall notify the United States and Defendants of any proposed divestiture required by Section VI of this Final Judgment. The notice provided to the United States shall set forth the details of the proposed divestiture and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered or expressed an interest in or desire to acquire any ownership interest in the Divestiture Assets, together with full details of the same.
B. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the United States of such notice, the United States may request from Defendants, the proposed Acquirer, any other third party, or the trustee, if applicable, additional information concerning the proposed divestiture, the proposed Acquirer, and any other potential Acquirer. Defendants and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
C. Within forty-five (45) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within thirty (30) calendar days after the United States has been provided the additional information requested from Defendants, the proposed Acquirer, any third party, and the trustee, whichever is later, the United States shall provide written notice to Defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States provides written notice that it does not object, the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to Defendants' limited right to object to the sale under Section VI C. of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed Acquirer or upon objection by the United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or Section VI shall not be consummated. Upon objection by Defendants under Section VI C., a divestiture proposed under Section VI shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VIII. FINANCING
Defendants shall not finance all or any part of any purchase made pursuant to Section IV or VI of this Final Judgment.
IX. HOLD SEPARATE
Until the divestitures required by this Final Judgment have been accomplished, Defendants shall take all steps necessary to comply with the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered by this Court. Defendants shall take no action that would jeopardize the divestitures ordered by this Court.
X. AFFIDAVITS
A. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, and every thirty (30) calendar days thereafter until the divestitures have been completed under Section IV or VI, Defendants shall deliver to the United States an affidavit as to the fact and manner of their compliance with Section IV or VI of this Final Judgment. Each such affidavit shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding thirty (30) calendar days, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts Defendants have taken to solicit buyers for the Divestiture Assets, and to provide required information to prospective Acquirers, including the limitations, if any, on such information. Assuming the information set forth in the affidavit is true and complete, any objection by the United States to information provided by Defendants, including limitations on information, shall be made within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such affidavit.
B. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, Defendants shall deliver to the United States an affidavit that describes in reasonable detail all actions Defendants have taken and all steps Defendants have implemented on an ongoing basis to comply with Section IX of this Final Judgment. Defendants shall deliver to the United States an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in Defendants' earlier affidavits filed pursuant to this Section within fifteen (15) calendar days after the change is implemented.
C. Defendants shall keep all records of all efforts made to preserve and divest the Divestiture Assets until one year after such divestiture has been completed.

In any instance where a third party has a right to a divested intangible asset pursuant to an agreement with any defendant, and where the agreement was entered into prior to the date of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, the Acquirer of that divested asset shall enter into an agreement with that third party to provide it with a right to that asset under terms and conditions sufficient to satisfy defendants' obligations under the original agreement.
T. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, the divestitures pursuant to Section IV, or by trustee appointed pursuant to Section V, of this Final Judgment, shall include the entire Divestiture Assets, and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that the Divestiture Assets can and will be used by the Acquirer or Acquirers as part of a viable, ongoing business engaged in the design, development, production, marketing, servicing, distribution, and sale of the Relevant Products. Divestiture of the Divestiture Assets may be made to one or more Acquirers, provided that in each instance it is demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of the United States that the Divestiture Assets will remain viable and the divestiture of such assets will remedy the competitive harm alleged in the Complaint. The divestitures, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V of this Final Judgment:
shall be made to an Acquirer or Acquirers that, in the United States's sole judgment, has the intent and capability (including the necessary managerial, operational, technical and financial capability) of competing effectively as a supplier of the Relevant Products; and
shall be accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that none of the terms of any agreement between the Acquirer or Acquirers and defendants give defendants the ability unreasonably to raise the Acquirer's or Acquirers' costs, to lower the Acquirer's or Acquirers' efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the Acquirer or Acquirers to compete effectively.
V. APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE
A. If Bemis has not divested the Divestiture Assets within the time period specified in Section IV(A), Bemis shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestiture of the Divestiture Assets.
B. After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the Divestiture Assets. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture to an Acquirer or Acquirers acceptable to the United States at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, and VI of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court deems appropriate. Subject to Section V(D) of this Final Judgment, the trustee may hire at the cost and expense of Bemis any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents, who shall be solely accountable to the trustee, reasonably necessary in the trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture.
C. Defendants shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by defendants must be conveyed in writing to the United States and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VI.
D. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of Bemis, on such terms and conditions as the United States approves, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to defendants and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of the trustee and any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the Divestiture Assets and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished, but timeliness is paramount.
E. Defendants shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestitures. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the business to be divested, and defendants shall develop financial and other information relevant to such business as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to reasonable protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestitures.
F. After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the United States and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestitures ordered under this Final Judgment. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the Divestiture Assets.
G. If the trustee has not accomplished the divestitures ordered under this Final Judgment within six (6) months after his or her appointment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth: (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestitures; (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestitures have not been accomplished; and (3) the trustee's recommendations. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the United States, which shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VI. NOTICE OF PROPOSED DIVESTITURE
A. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, Bemis shall notify the United States of any proposed divestiture required by Section IV of this Final Judgment. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, the trustee shall notify the United States and defendants of any proposed divestiture required by Section V of this Final Judgment. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestiture and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered or expressed an interest in or desire to acquire any ownership interest in the Divestiture Assets, together with full details of the same.
B. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the United States of such notice, the United States may request from defendants, the proposed Acquirer or Acquirers, any other third party, or the trustee, if applicable, additional information concerning the proposed divestiture, the proposed Acquirer or Acquirers, and any other potential Acquirer. Defendants and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
C. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after the United States has been provided the additional information requested from defendants, the proposed Acquirer or Acquirers, any third party, and the trustee, whichever is later, the United States shall provide written notice to defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States provides written notice that it does not object, the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to defendants' limited right to object to the sale under Section V(C) of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed Acquirer or Acquirers or upon objection by the United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or Section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by defendants under Section V(C), a divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VII. FINANCING
Defendants shall not finance all or any part of any purchase made pursuant to Section IV or V of this Final Judgment.
VIII. HOLD SEPARATE
Until the divestitures required by this Final Judgment have been accomplished, defendants shall take all steps necessary to comply with the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered by this Court. Defendants shall take no action that would jeopardize the divestitures ordered by this Court.
IX. AFFIDAVITS
A. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, and every thirty (30) calendar days thereafter until the divestitures have been completed under Section IV or V, Bemis shall deliver to the United States an affidavit as to the fact and manner of its compliance with Section IV or V of this Final Judgment. Each such affidavit shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding thirty (30) calendar days, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts Bemis has taken to solicit buyers for the Divestiture Assets, and to provide required information to prospective Acquirers, including the limitations, if any, on such information. Assuming the information set forth in the affidavit is true and complete, any objection by the United States to information provided by Bemis, including limitations on information, shall be made within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such affidavit.
B. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, Bemis shall deliver to the United States an affidavit that describes in reasonable detail all actions defendants have taken and all steps defendants have implemented on an ongoing basis to comply with Section VIII of this Final Judgment. Bemis shall deliver to the United States an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in defendants' earlier affidavits filed pursuant to this Section within fifteen (15) calendar days after the change is implemented.
C. Defendants shall keep all records of all efforts made to preserve and divest the Divestiture Assets until one year after such divestiture has been completed.
X. COMPLIANCE INSPECTION
A. For the purposes of determining or securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or of determining whether the Final Judgment should be modified or vacated, and subject to any legally recognized privilege, from time to time authorized representatives of the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division, including consultants and other persons retained by the United States, shall, upon written request of an authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, and on reasonable notice to defendants, be permitted:

C.

D. If, at the time information or documents are furnished by defendants to the United States, defendants represent and identify in writing the material in any such information or documents to which a claim of protection may be asserted under Rule 26(c)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and defendants mark each pertinent page of such material, ""Subject to claim of protection under Rule 26(c)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,"" then the United States shall give defendants ten (10) calendar days notice prior to divulging such material in any legal proceeding (other than a grand jury proceeding).

more than 3 times the greater of your prior monthly or average monthly charge, but if you have been a customer continuously for more than 1 year, the liquidated damages would be reduced to 2 times the greater of your prior monthly or average monthly charge; you will be able to choose on the contract which specific types of waste hauling services you would like us to perform. On or before the termination date of your existing service contract, BFI will offer you continued service under the new contract.

                                                   Page 15
if you request a contract with a term longer than 2 years, you can cancel that contract by giving us notice at any time up to 30 days prior to the end of the first 2 years; you can choose to terminate the contract at any other time, but you will be required to pay, as liquidated damages, no more than 3 times the greater of your prior monthly or average monthly charge. If you've been a customer continuously for more than 1 year, the liquidated damages would be reduced to 2 times the greater of your prior monthly or average monthly charge; you will be able to choose on the contract which specific types of waste hauling services you would like us to perform. You may obtain a new contract containing these terms by calling [insert BFI contact and number]. If you prefer, you may continue with your existing contract. If you retain your existing contract, we will not enforce any terms that are inconsistent with the new form contract terms. If you have any questions, please call [BFI contact person and phone number.] EXHIBIT C REMINDER: Your contract will automatically renew 90 days from the date of this notice unless we receive your cancellation within 60 days from the date of this notice. You may also obtain a new form contract for solid waste hauling services with some terms more advantageous to you than your current contract. We will send you a copy on request. Existing contract terms inconsistent with the new form will not be enforced against you. ."

DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS
A.

BFI is further ordered and directed to notify plaintiffs in writing immediately when it has elected or appointed a majority of the Attwoods Board of Directors.

Divestiture under Section IV.A or by the trustee, shall be made to a purchaser or purchasers for whom it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the United States, after consultation with Florida and Maryland, that (1) the purchase or purchases is or are for the purpose of competing effectively in at least small container solid waste hauling and (2) the purchaser or purchasers has or have the managerial, operational, and financial capability to compete effectively in at least small container solid waste hauling.
C. BFI shall not require of the purchaser or purchasers, as a condition of sale, that any current employee of the Divestiture Assets be offered or guaranteed continued employment after the divestiture.
D. BFI shall take all reasonable steps to accomplish quickly the divestiture contemplated by this Final Judgment.
V
APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE
A. In the event that BFI has not divested all of its interest required by Section IV.A by the time set forth in Section IV.A, the Court shall, on application of the United States, after consultation with Florida and Maryland, appoint a trustee selected by the United States to effect the remainder of the divestiture required by Section IV.A. After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the assets required to be divested pursuant to Section IV.A. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture at the best price then obtainable upon a reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Section VI of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as the Court shall deem appropriate. Defendant shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any grounds other than the trustee's malfeasance, or on the grounds that the sale is contrary to the express terms of this Final Judgment. Any such objections by defendant must be conveyed in writing to plaintiffs and the trustee within ten (10) days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VI.
B. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of BFI, on such terms and conditions as the Court may prescribe, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services, all remaining money shall be paid to BFI and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of such trustee shall be reasonable and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished.
C. BFI shall use its best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the Divestiture Assets, and defendant shall develop financial or other information relevant to such assets as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to reasonable protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Defendant shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture.
D. After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the parties and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestiture ordered under this Final Judgment. If the trustee has not accomplished such divestiture within six (6) months after its appointment, the trustee shall thereupon promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture, (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestiture has not been accomplished, and (3) the trustee's recommendations. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the parties, who shall each have the right to be heard and to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court shall thereafter enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate in order to carry out the purpose of the trust, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States, after consultation with Florida and Maryland.
E. Defendant shall give 45 days' notice to the United States, to Florida and to Maryland prior to:
(1) acquiring any interest in any assets other than in the ordinary course of business of any person that, at any time during the 12 months immediately preceding the acquisition, was engaged in the solid waste hauling industry in Maryland, Florida, Delaware or Pennsylvania where that person had small container revenues in excess of $500,000 per year or total revenues in excess of $1 million per year;

(3) selling or transferring to any firm engaged in the solid waste hauling industry in the United States any of defendant's assets other than in the ordinary course of business that at any time during the 12 months immediately preceding the sale or transfer were used in the solid waste hauling industry in Maryland, Florida, Delaware or Pennsylvania where the assets are small container assets that generated in excess of $500,000 in revenues per year or where total revenues are in excess of $1 million per year;

(4) selling or transferring to any firm engaged in the solid waste hauling industry in Maryland, Florida, Delaware or Pennsylvania any of defendant's equity securities or any other securities with voting rights if the sale would give control over a solid waste hauling operation that generated small container revenues in excess of $500,000 per year or total revenues of $1 million per year.

F. Defendant shall give 45 days' notice to the United States and to Maryland prior to:
(1) acquiring any interest in any assets other than in the ordinary course of business of any person that, at any time during the 12 months immediately preceding the acquisition, was engaged in the solid waste hauling industry in Maryland, Delaware or the counties of Pennsylvania contiguous to Maryland, where the revenues of that person, when aggregated with the revenues of any person or persons acquired in the previous 6 months, exceed the revenue limits of paragraph E (1) above;

(2) acquiring any capital stock, or any other securities with voting rights of any supplier of solid waste hauling services, that at any time during the 12 months immediately preceding the acquisition had been engaged in the solid waste hauling industry in Maryland, Delaware or the counties of Pennsylvania contiguous to Maryland, where the revenues of that person, when aggregated with the revenues of any person or persons acquired in the previous 6 months, exceed the revenue limits of paragraph E (2) above.

H. The purchaser or purchasers of the Divestiture Assets, or any of them, shall not, without the prior written consent of the United States, after consultation with Florida and Maryland, sell any of those assets to, or combine any of those assets with, those of BFI during the life of this decree.

Cargill is ordered and directed, within 150 days after filing of the Complaint in this action, or within five (5) days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to divest the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets to an acquirer acceptable to plaintiff United States, in its sole discretion.
C. Defendant Cargill is ordered and directed, within 30 days after the filing of the Complaint in this action, to divest the Relevant Bulk Deicing Assets to American. Cargill is further ordered and directed, within 12 months after filing of the Complaint in this action, or five (5) days after the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to grant American an irrevocable option to acquire, at book value or cost (whichever is lowest), the Additional Rock Salt Terminals, or where Cargill does not own an Additional Rock Salt Terminal, Cargill must offer to assign to American its rights in that terminal. American must exercise its option to acquire or accept assignment of such rights and obligations in any or all of the Additional Rock Salt Terminals within seven (7) months after it has received such option or assignment offer from defendant Cargill.
D. Defendant Akzo is ordered and directed to divest the Hampton Corners Mine Rights to American. In the event that American defaults on its purchase of the Hampton Corners Mine Rights, Akzo is ordered and directed to divest the Hampton Corners Mine Rights, within 120 days after default, to an acquirer acceptable to the United States, New York and Pennsylvania, in their sole discretion.
E. In the event that American defaults on its purchase of the Retsof Stockpile, Cargill is ordered and directed to divest the Retsof Stockpile, within 120 days after default, to an acquirer acceptable to the United States, New York and Pennsylvania, in their sole discretion.
F. In the event that American decides to sell or otherwise assign its rights to the Relevant Bulk Deicing Assets or the Retsof Stockpile, American shall provide plaintiffs United States, New York and Pennsylvania with thirty days' written notice of the proposed sale or assignment. Any such a sale or assignment shall be made to an acquirer acceptable to the United States, New York and Pennsylvania, in their sole discretion.
G. Unless plaintiffs United States, New York and Pennsylvania otherwise consent in writing (or in the case of the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets, the United States alone consents in writing), the divestitures pursuant to Section IV (B), (D) and (E) of this Final Judgment, or by the trustee appointed pursuant to Section V, shall include all of the Relevant Assets, and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy: (a) the United States, New York and Pennsylvania, in their sole discretion, that the Retsof Stockpile and Hampton Corners Mine Rights can and will be used by an acquirer (or acquirers) as part of a viable, ongoing business engaged in the sale and distribution of bulk deicing salt in the Northeast United States; and (b) in the case of the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets, the United States alone, in its sole discretion, that the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets will be used as part of a viable, ongoing business engaged in the sale of food grade evaporated salt. The divestitures, whether pursuant to Section IV (B), (D) and (E) or V of the Final Judgment, shall be made (1) to an acquirer that, in the sole judgment of plaintiffs United States, New York and Pennsylvania (or in the case of the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets, plaintiff United States's sole judgment), has the capability and intent of competing effectively, and has the managerial, operational and financial capability to compete effectively as a seller of bulk deicing or food grade salt; and (2) pursuant to agreements the terms of which shall not, in the sole judgment of plaintiffs United States, New York and Pennsylvania (or in the case of the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets, plaintiff United States's sole judgment), interfere with the ability of any acquirer to compete effectively.
H. Defendants Akzo (in the case of the Hampton Corners Mine Rights) and Cargill (in the case of the Retsof Stockpile, and Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets) are ordered and directed to use their best efforts to divest said assets or assign said rights, and to use their best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals necessary for such divestitures, as expeditiously as possible. Plaintiffs United States, New York and Pennsylvania, in their sole discretion (or in the case of the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets, the United States alone) may extend the time period for each such divestiture for two (2) additional thirty-day periods of time, not to exceed 60 calendar days in total.
I. In accomplishing the divestiture ordered by this Final Judgment, defendant Cargill promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets. In the event of default on the Hampton Corners Mine Rights, Akzo promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of the Hampton Corners Mine Rights. In the event of default on the Retsof Stockpile, Cargill promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of the Retsof Stockpile.
Akzo and Cargill shall inform any person making a bona fide inquiry regarding a possible purchase that the sale is being made pursuant to the Final Judgment and provide such person with a copy of the Final Judgment. Akzo and Cargill shall make known to any person making an inquiry which Relevant Assets are available for sale. Akzo and Cargill also shall offer to furnish to all bona fide prospective acquirers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information regarding the Relevant Assets customarily provided in a due diligence process, except such information that is subject to attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product privilege. Akzo and Cargill shall make available such information to plaintiffs at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
J. Akzo and Cargill shall permit bona fide prospective acquirers of the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets to have access to personnel and to make such inspection of all Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets, and any and all financial, operational or other documents and information, as is customary in a due diligence process.
K. Defendants Akzo and Cargill shall not interfere with any efforts by any acquirer to interview or employ the general manager or any other employee of Akzo's Watkins Glen, New York evaporated salt plant.
L. Akzo and Cargill shall not take any action, direct or indirect (not including otherwise lawful competitive price action, expansion of capacity or similar competitive conduct), that will impede in any way the development of the Hampton Corners Mine Rights.
V. APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE
A. In the event that Cargill has not divested the Retsof Stockpile or the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets, or Akzo has not divested the Hampton Corners Mine Rights, within the applicable time period specified in Section IV above, the Court shall appoint, on application of plaintiff United States, a trustee selected by the United States to effect the divestiture of the assets.
B. After the trustee's appointment has become effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the assets that have not been timely divested. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture at the best price then obtainable upon a reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Section IV and VI of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as the Court shall deem appropriate. Subject to Section VI of this Final Judgment, the trustee shall have the power and authority to hire at the cost and expense of the party that has not made the pertinent divestiture any investment bankers, attorneys or other agents reasonably necessary in the judgment of the trustee to assist in the divestiture, and such professionals or agents shall be solely accountable to the trustee. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture at the earliest possible time to a purchaser acceptable to plaintiffs United States, New York and Pennsylvania, in their sole judgment (or in the case of the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets, the United States alone), and shall have such other powers as this Court shall deem appropriate. Defendants shall not object to the sale of any of the Relevant Assets by the trustee on any grounds other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objection by defendants must be conveyed in writing to plaintiffs and the trustee no later than 15 calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VII of this Final Judgment.
C. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of Cargill (in the case of the Retsof Stockpile or Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets) and Akzo (in the case of the Hampton Corners Mine Rights) on such terms and conditions as the Court may prescribe, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining monies shall be paid to Cargill (in the case of the Retsof Stockpile or the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets) and Akzo (in the case of the Hampton Corners Mine Rights), and the trustee's services shall then be terminated. The compensation of such trustee and of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the divestiture and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished.
D. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture of any assets, and shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture, including best efforts to effect all necessary regulatory approvals. Subject to a customary confidentiality agreement, the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records and facilities related to the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets, Retsof Stockpile, or Hampton Corners Mine Rights, and defendants shall develop such financial or other information as may be necessary for the divestiture of these assets. Defendants shall permit prospective acquirers of the assets to have access to personnel and to make such inspection of physical facilities and any and all financial, operational or other documents and information as may be relevant to the divestiture required by this Final Judgment.
E. After its appointment becomes effective, the trustee shall file monthly reports with Cargill (in the case of the Retsof Stockpile or the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets), Akzo (in the case of the Hampton Corners Mine Rights), plaintiffs, and the Court, setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish divestiture of the assets as contemplated under this Final Judgment; provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the court. Such reports shall include the name, address and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Relevant Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the Relevant Assets.
F. Within six (6) months after its appointment has become effective, if the trustee has not accomplished the divestiture required by Section IV of this Final Judgment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture, (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestiture has not been accomplished, and (3) the trustee's recommendations, provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such reports to plaintiffs and Cargill and Akzo, which shall each have the right to be heard and to make additional recommendations. The Court shall thereafter enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to accomplish the purpose of this Final Judgment, which shall, if necessary, include extending the term of the trustee's appointment.
VI. PRESERVATION OF ASSETS/HOLD SEPARATE
Until the divestiture of the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets required by Section IV of the Final Judgment has been accomplished:
A. Defendants Cargill and Akzo shall take all steps necessary to operate Akzo's Watkins Glen, New York evaporated salt plant as a separate, independent, ongoing, economically viable and active competitor to defendant Cargill's other evaporated salt plants and solar salt operations in the United States, and shall take all steps necessary to ensure that, except as necessary to comply with Section IV and paragraphs B and C of this Section of the Final Judgment, management of the Watkins Glen, New York evaporated salt plant, including the performance of decision-making functions regarding marketing and pricing, will be kept separate and apart from, and not influenced by, defendant Cargill.
B. Defendant Cargill shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain and increase sales of evaporated salt products by Akzo's Watkins Glen, New York evaporated salt plant and shall maintain at 1996 or previously approved levels for 1997, whichever are higher, promotional advertising, sales, marketing and merchandising support for salt products produced by Akzo's Watkins Glen, New York evaporated salt plant.
C. Defendants Cargill and Akzo shall take all steps necessary to ensure that the assets used in the operation of Akzo's Watkins Glen, New York plant, and managers, technical and operating and employees of that plant shall not be transferred or reassigned to any other facility, except for transfer bids initiated by employees pursuant to a defendant's regular, established job posting policies, provided that the defendant gives plaintiff United States and the acquirer ten (10) days' notice of such transfer.
D. Defendants Cargill and Akzo shall not, except as part of a divestiture approved by plaintiffs United States, New York and Pennsylvania, sell any salt from the Retsof Stockpile.
E. Defendants Cargill and Akzo shall take no action, other than lawful competitive price action, expansion of capacity, or similar competitive conduct, that may jeopardize sale or assignment of the Retsof Stockpile, Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets, Additional Rock Salt Terminals, or Hampton Corners Mine Rights.
F. Defendants Cargill and Akzo shall appoint a person or persons to oversee the assets to be held separate and who will be responsible for each defendant's compliance with Section VI of the Final Judgment.
VII. NOTIFICATION
Within two (2) business days following execution of a binding agreement to divest, including all contemplated ancillary agreements (e.g., financing), to effect any proposed divestiture pursuant to Section IV or V of the Final Judgment, Cargill or Akzo or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture, shall notify plaintiffs of the proposed divestiture. If the trustee is responsible for effecting the divestiture, it shall similarly notify Cargill and Akzo. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed transaction and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered to, or expressed an interest in or a desire to, acquire any ownership interest in the Relevant Evaporated Salt Assets, together with full details of same. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by plaintiffs of such notice, plaintiffs may request from defendants, the proposed acquirer or acquirers, any other third party, or the trustee, if applicable, additional information concerning the proposed divestiture, the proposed acquirer, and any other potential acquirer. Defendants and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after plaintiffs have been provided the additional information, whichever is later, plaintiffs United States, New York and Pennsylvania shall provide written notice to defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not they object to the proposed divestiture. If plaintiffs United States, New York and Pennsylvania fail to object within the period specified, or if they provide written notice to defendants and the trustee, if there is one, that they do not object, then the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to a defendant's limited right to object to the sale under Section V(B) of this Final Judgment. A divestiture proposed under Section IV (A), (C) or (D) shall not be consummated if plaintiffs United States, New York or Pennsylvania object to it. A divestiture proposed under Section IV (B) shall not be consummated if plaintiff United States objects to it. Upon objection by the United States, or by Cargill or Akzo under the proviso in Section V(B), a divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VIII. FINANCING
Defendants are ordered and directed not to finance all or any part of any purchase by an acquirer made pursuant to Sections IV or V of this Final Judgment without the prior written consent of plaintiffs United States, New York and Pennsylvania.
IX. AFFIDAVITS
A. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of this Final Judgment and every thirty (30) calendar days thereafter until the divestiture has been completed, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V of this Final Judgment, defendants shall deliver to plaintiffs an affidavit as to the fact and manner of defendants' compliance with Section IV or V of this Final Judgment. Each such affidavit shall include, inter alia, the name, address and telephone number of each person who, at any time after the period covered by the last such report, was contacted by defendants, or their representatives, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Relevant Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts that defendants have taken to solicit a buyer for the Relevant Assets.
B. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of this Final Judgment, Cargill shall deliver to the United States an affidavit which describes in reasonable detail all actions defendants have taken and all steps defendants have implemented on an on-going basis to preserve the Relevant Assets pursuant to Section VI of this Final Judgment. Cargill shall deliver to plaintiffs an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in their earlier affidavit(s) filed pursuant to the Section within fifteen (15) calendar days after such change is implemented.
C. Cargill and Akzo shall preserve all records of all efforts made to preserve and to divest the Relevant Assets.
X. COMPLIANCE INSPECTION
For the purpose of determining or securing compliance with the Final Judgment and subject to any legally recognized privilege, from time to time:
A. Duly authorized representatives of plaintiff United States, including consultants and other persons retained by the United States, shall, upon written request of the United States Attorney General, or of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, and on reasonable notice to defendants or American made to their principal offices, be permitted:
Access during office hours of defendants to inspect and copy all books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda and other records and documents in the possession or under the control of defendants, who may have counsel present, relating to any matters contained in the Final Judgment; and

C. No information or documents obtained by the means provided in Section IX or this Section X shall be divulged by any representative of the United States to any person other than a duly authorized representative of the Executive Branch of the United States, except in the course of legal proceedings to which the United States is a party (including grand jury proceedings), or for the purpose of securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or as otherwise required by law.
D. If at the time information or documents are furnished by a defendant to plaintiffs, and such defendant represents and identifies in writing the material in any such information or documents to which a claim of protection may be asserted under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and such defendant marks each pertinent page of such material, ""Subject to claim of protection under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,"" then ten (10) calendar days' notice shall be given by plaintiffs to such defendant prior to divulging such material in any legal proceeding (other than a grand jury proceeding) to which such defendant is not a party.

IV.
DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS
A. Cargill is hereby ordered and directed, within five (5) months from the date this Final Judgment is filed with the Court, or five (5) calendar days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to divest all of its property rights in the East Dubuque river elevator and Morris river elevator to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion. It is hereby ordered and directed, within six (6) months from the date this Final Judgment is filed with the Court, or five (5) calendar days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to divest all of its property rights in the Seattle port elevator to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion. The United States, in its sole discretion, may agree to an extension of the time period, and shall notify the Court in such circumstances.
B. Notwithstanding Section IV.A, the Acquirer of the Seattle port elevator may enter into a Standard Throughput Agreement with Cargill, or any joint venture involving the Tacoma elevator to which Cargill is a party (the ""Cargill Joint Venture""), provided that: (1) the Acquirer has no interest in Cargill or the Cargill Joint Venture; (2) the throughput agreement gives Cargill or the Cargill Joint Venture no more rights concerning the operations of the facility than are commonly granted to sublessees in Standard Throughput Agreements; (3) and Cargill or the Cargill Joint Venture obtains continuing rights to move no more than 8.5 million bushels of grain and oilseeds combined in any given month through the Seattle port elevator.
C. Notwithstanding Section IV.A and IV.B, Cargill need not divest the Seattle port elevator if it does not buy, lease or otherwise acquire an interest in Continental's port elevator at or near Tacoma, Washington.
D. Continental is hereby ordered and directed, within five (5) months from the date this Final Judgment is filed with the Court, or five (5) calendar days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to divest all of its property rights in the Lockport river elevator, Caruthersville river elevator, Salina rail elevator, Troy rail elevator, Beaumont port elevator, Stockton port elevator and Chicago port elevator to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion. The United States, in its sole discretion, may agree to an extension of the time period, and shall notify the Court in such circumstances.
E. Unless the United States consents in writing, the divestiture pursuant to Section IV or by trustee appointed pursuant to Section V of this Final Judgment, shall include the entire Assets defined above (as qualified by Section IV.B and IV.C). Divestiture shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that the Assets can and will be operated by the Acquirer as a viable, ongoing business. Divestiture of the Assets, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V of this Final Judgment, shall be made to an Acquirer for whom it is demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of the United States that: (1) the purchase is for the purpose of using the Asset to compete effectively in the grain business, (2) the Acquirer has the managerial, operational, and financial capability to use the Asset to compete effectively in the grain business; and (3) none of the terms of any agreement between the Acquirer and defendant(s) give defendant(s) the ability unreasonably to raise the Acquirer's costs, to lower the Acquirer's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability or incentive of the Acquirer to compete effectively. Moreover, the United States must be satisfied, in its sole discretion, that any Standard Throughput Agreement that may be negotiated between Cargill or the Cargill Joint Venture and the Acquirer of the Seattle port elevator: (1) would leave the Acquirer with sufficient capacity for it to be a viable and effective competitor for the purchase of corn and soybeans in the Pacific Northwest draw area; and (2) would not adversely affect the Acquirer's ability or incentives to compete vigorously for the origination of corn and soybeans in the Pacific Northwest draw area, by raising the Acquirer's costs, lowering its efficiency, or otherwise interfering in the ability or incentive of the Acquirer to compete effectively.
F. In accomplishing the divestiture ordered by this Final Judgment, defendants shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of the Assets. Defendants shall provide any person making inquiry regarding a possible purchase a copy of the Final Judgment. The pertinent defendant shall also offer to furnish to any prospective purchaser, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information regarding the Assets customarily provided in a due diligence process, except such information subject to attorney client privilege or attorney work product privilege. The pertinent defendant shall make available such information to the United States at the same time that such information is made available to any other person. The pertinent defendant shall permit prospective purchasers of the Assets to have reasonable access to personnel and to make such inspection of physical facilities and any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.
G. Defendants shall not interfere with any negotiations by the Acquirer to employ any employee whose primary responsibility involves the use of the Assets.
H. Defendants shall take all reasonable steps to accomplish the prompt divestitures contemplated by this Final Judgment. Defendants shall not take any action other than in the ordinary course of business that will impede in any way the operation of the Assets.
I. Cargill shall not purchase, lease or acquire any interest in the Lockport river elevator, Caruthersville river elevator, Salina rail elevator, Troy rail elevator, Beaumont port elevator, Stockton port elevator or Chicago port elevator, or any interest in the river elevator at or near Birds Point, Missouri (in which Continental formerly owned a minority interest, and had a right of first refusal to purchase grain). If another firm acquires the Tacoma port elevator pursuant to a right of first refusal (and Cargill therefore retains the Seattle port elevator), Cargill shall not subsequently purchase or lease the Tacoma port elevator. If another firm acquires the Tacoma port elevator pursuant to a right of first refusal, Cargill shall not subsequently acquire any other interest in that facility (including a joint venture interest) without the written consent of the United States.
J. Cargill shall enter into a throughput agreement that makes one-third (1/3) of the daily loading capacity at its river elevator located at or near Havana, Illinois, or one barge-load per day, whichever is greater, to an independent grain company acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion (the ""Havana Throughput Agreement""). Daily loading capacity shall be the capacity registered with the CBOT. The independent grain company that obtains the throughput right from Cargill (the ""third party"") must be qualified under CBOT rules and regulations to make delivery of at least one barge-load of corn and soybeans per day for the settlement of CBOT corn and soybean futures contracts, and must agree to register that capacity at the Havana facility with the CBOT.
The Havana Throughput Agreement shall allow the third party to use its share of the loading capacity at the Havana facility to transload grain from trucks onto barges for commercial purposes unrelated to futures contract deliveries, as well as to make deliveries under CBOT futures contracts. Cargill shall not be obligated by this Final Judgment to provide storage services to the third party in excess of the storage services required to accommodate the transloading of grain shipments from trucks to barges. Cargill's load-out fees, and its fees for any storage services that Cargill elects to provide for storage in excess of twenty-four hours from the time of truck unload to barge loading, may not exceed the load-out fees and daily storage rates published in applicable CBOT tariffs.
As part of the Havana Throughput Agreement, any dispute or disagreement between Cargill and the third party arising from or relating to the throughput agreement or the third party's use of Cargill's loading capacity at Havana shall be submitted, governed, and resolved in accordance with the arbitration rules of the CBOT to the extent such dispute or disagreement falls within the jurisdiction of the CBOT Arbitration Committees. To the extent such dispute or disagreement does not fall within CBOT jurisdiction, such dispute or disagreement shall be submitted, governed and resolved in accordance with the arbitration rules of the National Grain and Feed Association, or other arbitration body that is mutually agreed upon by Cargill and the third party. Cargill shall abide by the decisions of such arbitrators.
Cargill shall enter into the Havana Throughput Agreement within five (5) months from the date this Final Judgment is filed with the Court, or five (5) calendar days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later. The United States, in its sole discretion, may agree to an extension of the time period, and shall notify the Court in such circumstances. If Cargill has not entered into a Havana Throughput Agreement within this time period, a trustee shall be appointed to satisfy this requirement pursuant to the same conditions as are set forth in Section V.
V.
APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE
A. In the event that Cargill has not divested the East Dubuque river elevator, Morris river elevator or Seattle port elevator, or entered into the Havana Throughput Agreement, to the extent required by Section IV of the Final Judgment within the time period specified therein, or that Continental has not divested the Lockport river elevator, Caruthersville river elevator, Salina rail elevator, Troy rail elevator, Beaumont port elevator, Stockton port elevator or Chicago port elevator, to the extent required by Section IV of the Final Judgment, within the time period specified, it shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. In that event, and upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States to effect the divestiture of the Assets. Until such time as a trustee is appointed, defendants shall continue their efforts to effect the divestiture as specified in Section IV.
B. After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to divest the Assets. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture at the best price then obtainable upon a reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V and VIII of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as the Court shall deem appropriate. Subject to Section V. C. of this Final Judgment, the trustee shall have the power and authority to hire at the cost and expense of defendants any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents reasonably necessary in the judgment of the trustee to assist in the divestiture, and such professionals and agents shall be solely accountable to the trustee. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture at the earliest possible time to a purchaser acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion, and shall have such other powers as this Court shall deem appropriate. Defendants shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any grounds other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by defendants must be conveyed in writing to the United States and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VI of this Final Judgment.
C. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of the pertinent defendant, on such terms and conditions as the Court may prescribe, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the Assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to the pertinent defendant and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of such trustee and that of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished.
D. The pertinent defendant shall use its best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture, including their best efforts to effect all regulatory approvals and its best efforts to obtain any necessary consent of any persons from whom they lease the Assets. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of, and relating to, the Assets, and the pertinent defendant shall develop financial or other information relevant to such Assets customarily provided in a due diligence process as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to reasonable protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture. The pertinent defendant shall permit any prospective Acquirer of the Assets to have reasonable access to personnel and to make such inspection of physical facilities and any and all financial, operational, or other documents and other information as may be relevant to the divestitures required by this Final Judgment.
E. After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the parties and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestiture ordered under this Final Judgment; provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the Assets. If the trustee has not accomplished such divestiture within six (6) months after its appointment, the trustee shall thereupon promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture, (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestiture has not been accomplished, and (3) the trustee's recommendations; provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the parties, who shall each have the right to be heard and to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court shall thereafter enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate in order to carry out the purpose of the Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VI.
NOTIFICATION
A. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive agreement with respect to any of the Assets, the pertinent defendant or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture required herein, shall notify the United States of any proposed divestiture required by Section IV or V of this Final Judgment. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify the pertinent defendant. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed transaction and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered to, or expressed an interest in or desire to, acquire any ownership interest in the Assets, together with full details of the same. Within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the notice, the United States may request from the pertinent defendant, the proposed purchaser, or any third party additional information concerning the proposed divestiture, the proposed purchaser, and any other potential purchaser. The pertinent defendant or the trustee shall furnish the additional information within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of the additional information by the United States, whichever is later, the United States shall notify in writing the pertinent defendant and the trustee, if there is one, whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States notifies in writing the pertinent defendant and the trustee, if there is one, that it does not object, then the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to the pertinent defendant's limited right to object to the sale under Section V. B. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed purchaser or upon objection by the United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or V may not be consummated. Upon objection by a defendant under Section V. B., the proposed divestiture under Section V shall not be accomplished unless approved by the Court.
B. Twenty (20) calendar days from the date of the filing of this Final Judgment, and every thirty (30) calendar days thereafter until the divestiture has been completed under Section IV or V, each defendant shall deliver to the United States a written affidavit as to the fact and manner of compliance with Section IV or V of this Final Judgment. Each such affidavit shall include, for each person who during the preceding thirty (30) calendar days made an offer, expressed an interest or desire to acquire, entered into negotiations to acquire, or made an inquiry about acquiring any ownership interest in all or any portion of the Assets, the name, address, and telephone number of that person and a detailed description of each contact with that person during that period. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts that the pertinent defendant has taken to solicit an Acquirer for the relevant Assets and to provide required information to prospective Acquirers including the limitations, if any, on such information. Assuming that the information set forth in the affidavit is true and complete, any objection by the United States to the information provided by the defendants, including limitations on information, shall be made within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such affidavit. Until one year after each defendant has completed such divestitures, that defendant shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest all or any portion of the Assets.
VII.
FINANCING
Defendants shall not finance all or any part of any purchase of the Assets made pursuant to Sections IV or V of this Final Judgment. With respect to Assets leased by a defendant, however, the pertinent defendant will not violate this condition if: (1) the lessor holds the pertinent defendant responsible for lease payments under an assignment or sublease of the defendant's leasehold interests; or (2) the pertinent defendant makes up any shortfall between its lease payment obligations and the lease payments negotiated by the person to whom it assigns or subleases its leasehold interests.
VIII.
HOLD SEPARATE AND PRESERVATION OF ASSETS REQUIREMENTS
Unless otherwise indicated, from the date of filing of this proposed Final Judgment with the Court and until the divestitures required by Sections IV.A, IV.D and/or V of the Final Judgment, and the execution of the Havana Throughput Agreement required by Section IV.J, have been accomplished:
A. Subject to force majeure, defendants shall: (1) take all steps necessary to assure that the Assets and Cargill's Havana river elevator are maintained as separate, distinct and salable assets; and extend all reasonable efforts to maintain these facilities in a condition that makes them usable as grain elevators; (2) not sell, assign, transfer, or otherwise dispose of these facilities, or pledge them as collateral for loans, except in accordance with the Final Judgment; (3) take all steps necessary to preserve these facilities in a state of repair equal to their current state of repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted; (4) take all steps necessary to preserve the documents, books, customers lists and records relating to these facilities; (5) refrain from taking any actions that would jeopardize the sale of these facilities; and (6) continue to operate these facilities as grain elevators. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) if Continental's lease of the Salina rail elevator expired on or before April 30, 1999 and was not renewed, that facility shall not be subject to this section of the Final Judgment; and (b) if Cargill's lease of the East Dubuque river elevator expires prior to divestiture, Cargill shall not thereafter be subject to the provisions of this section if it has offered to extend the lease at rates and conditions substantially similar to the rates and conditions in its current lease, and the lessor has rejected that offer.
B. Except in the ordinary course of business or as is otherwise consistent with this Final Judgment, defendants shall not hire and shall not transfer or terminate, or alter, to the detriment of any employee, any current employment or salary agreements for any employees who on June 24, 1999 worked at any of the Assets, unless such individual has a written offer of employment from a third party for a like or better position.
C. Until such time as the Assets are divested: William F. Winnie shall manage the Beaumont port elevator, Caruthersville river elevator, Chicago port elevator, Lockport river elevator, Stockton port elevator and Troy rail elevator; Peter Reed shall manage the East Dubuque river elevator; Sharon Spies shall manage the Morris river elevator; and Donald Vogt shall manage the Seattle port elevator. These individuals shall have complete managerial responsibility for the Assets, subject to the provisions of the Final Judgment. In the event that these individuals are unwilling or unable to perform these duties, defendants shall appoint, subject to the United States' approval, a replacement acceptable to the United States within ten (10) working days. Should defendants fail to appoint a replacement acceptable to the United States within ten (10) working days, the United States may appoint a replacement.
D. Defendants shall take no action that would interfere with the ability of any trustee appointed pursuant to the Final Judgment to complete the divestiture pursuant to the Final Judgment to a suitable Acquirer.
E. Continental shall operate the Lockport river elevator, Caruthersville river elevator, Troy rail elevator, Beaumont port elevator, Stockton port elevator and Chicago port elevator independently from and in competition with Cargill. Defendants shall not implement any non-compete agreements until all of the Assets have been divested. The term of any such non-compete agreement shall not be more than three (3) years.
IX.
COMPLIANCE INSPECTION
For the purpose of determining or securing compliance with this Final Judgment, and subject to any legally recognized privilege, from time to time:
A. Duly authorized representatives of the United States, including consultants and other persons retained by the United States, shall, upon the written request of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, and on reasonable notice to defendants made to their principal offices, be permitted:
  1. access during office hours to inspect and copy all books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda, and other records and documents in the possession or under the control of defendants, which may have counsel present, relating to any matters contained in this Final Judgment; and

B. Upon the written request of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, made to defendants at their principal offices, defendants shall submit written reports, under oath if requested, with respect to any of the matters contained in this Final Judgment as may be requested.
C. No information nor any documents obtained by the means provided in Sections VIII or IX shall be divulged by any representative of the United States to any person other than a duly authorized representative of the Executive Branch of the United States, except in the course of legal proceedings to which the United States is a party (including grand jury proceedings), or for the purpose of securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or as otherwise required by law.
D. If at the time information or documents are furnished by a defendant to the United States, such defendant represents and identifies in writing the material in any such information or documents for which a claim of protection may be asserted under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and defendant marks each pertinent page of such material, ""Subject to claim of protection under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,"" then the United States shall give ten (10) calendar days' notice to defendant prior to divulging such material in any legal proceeding (other than a grand jury proceeding) to which defendant is not a party.

III. Applicability
A. This Final Judgment applies to defendants Cingular, SBC, BellSouth and AT&T Wireless, as defined above, and all other persons in active concert or participation with any of them who receive actual notice of this Final Judgment by personal service or otherwise.
B. Defendants shall require, as a condition of the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of their assets or of lesser business units that include the Divestiture Assets, that the purchaser agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Final Judgment, provided that defendants need not obtain such an agreement from the Acquirer(s).
IV. Divestitures
A. Defendants are ordered and directed, within 120 days after consummation of the Transaction, or five (5) days after notice of entry of this Final Judgment, whichever is later, to divest the Divestiture Assets to an Acquirer or Acquirers acceptable to plaintiff United States in its sole discretion upon consultation with any relevant plaintiff state, and, if applicable, to a Divestiture Trustee designated pursuant to Section V of this Final Judgment. Plaintiff United States, in its sole discretion upon consultation with any relevant plaintiff state, may agree to one or more extensions of this time period not to exceed 60 days in total, and shall notify the Court in such circumstances. With respect to divestiture of the Divestiture Assets by defendants or the Divestiture Trustee, if applications have been filed with the FCC within the period permitted for divestiture seeking approval to assign or transfer licenses to the Acquirer(s) of the Divestiture Assets, but an order or other dispositive action by the FCC on such applications has not been issued before the end of the period permitted for divestiture, the period shall be extended with respect to divestiture of those Divestiture Assets for which FCC approval has not been issued until five (5) days after such approval is received. Defendants agree to use their best efforts to accomplish the divestitures set forth in this Final Judgment and to seek all necessary regulatory approvals as expeditiously as possible. This Final Judgment does not limit the FCC's exercise of its regulatory powers and process with respect to the Divestiture Assets. Authorization by the FCC to conduct the divestiture of a Divestiture Asset in a particular manner will not modify any of the requirements of this decree.
B. In accomplishing the divestitures ordered by this Final Judgment, defendants shall promptly make known, if they have not already done so, by usual and customary means, the availability of the Divestiture Assets. Defendants shall inform any person making inquiry regarding a possible purchase of the Divestiture Assets that they are being divested pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide that person with a copy of this Final Judgment. Defendants shall offer to furnish to all prospective Acquirers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information and documents relating to the Divestiture Assets customarily provided in a due diligence process except such information or documents subject to the attorney-client or work product privileges. Defendants shall make available such information to plaintiffs at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
C. Defendants shall provide to the Acquirer(s) and plaintiffs information relating to the personnel involved in the operation, development, and sale of the Wireless Business Divestiture Assets to enable the Acquirer(s) to make offers of employment. Defendants will not interfere with any negotiations by the Acquirer(s) to employ any defendant employee whose primary responsibility is the operation, development, and sale of the Wireless Business Divestiture Assets.
D. Defendants shall permit prospective Acquirers of the Divestiture Assets to have reasonable access to personnel and to make inspections of the of the Divestiture Assets; access to any and all environmental, zoning, and other permit documents and information; and access to any and all financial, operational, and other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.
E. Defendants shall warrant to all Acquirer(s) that (1) each asset of the Wireless Business Divestiture Assets will be operational on the date of sale, and (2) every wireless spectrum license is in full force and effect on the date of sale.
F. Defendants shall not take any action that will impede in any way the permitting, licensing, operation, or divestiture of the Divestiture Assets.
G. Defendants shall warrant to the Acquirer(s) of the Divestiture Assets that there are no material defects in the environmental, zoning, licensing or other permits pertaining to the operation of each asset, and that following the sale of the Divestiture Assets, defendants will not undertake, directly or indirectly, any challenges to the environmental, zoning, licensing or other permits relating to the operation of the Divestiture Assets.
H. Unless plaintiff United States otherwise consents in writing, upon consultation with any relevant plaintiff state, the divestitures pursuant to Section IV, or by a Divestiture Trustee appointed pursuant to Section V of this Final Judgment, shall include the entire Divestiture Assets and with respect to the Wireless Business Divestiture Assets and Spectrum License Divestiture Assets, shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy plaintiff United States, in its sole discretion upon consultation with any relevant plaintiff state, that these assets can and will be used by the Acquirer(s) as part of a viable, ongoing business engaged in the provision of mobile wireless services. Divestiture of the Divestiture Assets may be made to one or more Acquirers, provided that in each instance it is demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of plaintiff United States upon consultation with any relevant plaintiff state, that the Divestiture Assets will remain viable and the divestiture of such assets will remedy the competitive harm alleged in the Complaint. The divestitures of the Wireless Business Divestiture Assets and Spectrum License Divestiture Assets, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V of this Final Judgment,
shall be made to an Acquirer (or Acquirers) that, in plaintiff United States's sole judgment upon consultation with any relevant plaintiff state, has the intent and capability (including the necessary managerial, operational, technical, and financial capability) of competing effectively in the provision of mobile wireless services; and
shall be accomplished so as to satisfy plaintiff United States in its sole discretion upon consultation with any relevant plaintiff state, that none of the terms of any agreement between the Acquirer (or Acquirers) and any defendant shall give defendants the ability unreasonably to raise the Acquirer's costs, to lower the Acquirer's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere with the ability of the Acquirer to compete effectively.
I. At the option of the Acquirer(s), defendants shall enter into a contract for transition services customarily provided in connection with the sale of a business providing mobile wireless services sufficient to meet all or part of the needs of the Acquirer'(s) needs for a period of up to one year. The terms and conditions of any contractual arrangement meant to satisfy this provision must be reasonably related to market conditions.
J. To the extent that the mobile wireless businesses to be divested use intellectual property, as required to be identified by Section II.L, that cannot be transferred or assigned without the consent of the licensor or other third parties, defendants shall use their best efforts to obtain those consents.
K. In the event plaintiff United States approves retention of any Minority Interests, defendants shall not obtain any additional equity interest in such entity.
V. Appointment of Divestiture Trustee
A. If defendants have not divested the Divestiture Assets within the time period specified in Section IV.A, defendants shall notify plaintiff United States and any relevant plaintiff state of that fact in writing, specifically identifying the Divestiture Assets that have not been divested. Then, upon application of plaintiff United States, upon consultation with any plaintiff state, the Court shall appoint a Divestiture Trustee selected by plaintiff United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestiture of the Divestiture Assets. The Divestiture Trustee, will have all the rights and responsibilities of the Management Trustee appointed pursuant to the Preservation of Assets Stipulation and Order, and will be responsible for:
(1) accomplishing divestiture of all Divestiture Assets transferred to the Divestiture Trustee from defendants, in accordance with the terms of this Final Judgment, to an Acquirer or Acquirers approved by plaintiff United States, upon consultation with any relevant plaintiff state, under Sections IV.A and IV.C of this Final Judgment, and
(2) exercising the responsibilities of the licensee of any transferred Divestiture Assets and controlling and operating any transferred Wireless Business Divestiture Assets, to ensure that the businesses remain ongoing, economically viable competitors in the provision of mobile wireless services in the five (5) license areas specified in the Wireless Business Divestiture Assets, until they are divested to an Acquirer or Acquirers, and the Divestiture Trustee shall agree to be bound by this Final Judgment.
B. Defendants shall submit a proposed trust agreement (""Trust Agreement"") to plaintiff United States and any relevant plaintiff state, which must be consistent with the terms of this Final Judgment and which must receive approval by plaintiff United States in its sole discretion, upon consultation with any relevant plaintiff state, who shall communicate to defendants within ten (10) business days its approval or disapproval of the proposed Trust Agreement, and which must be executed by the defendants and the Divestiture Trustee within five (5) business days after approval by plaintiff United States; and
C. After obtaining any necessary approvals from the FCC for the assignment of the licenses of the remaining Divestiture Assets to the Divestiture Trustee, defendants shall irrevocably divest the remaining Divestiture Assets to the Divestiture Trustee, who will own such assets (or own the stock of the entity owning such assets, if divestiture is to be effected by the creation of such an entity for sale to Acquirer(s)) and control such assets, subject to the terms of the approved Trust Agreement.
D. After the appointment of a Divestiture Trustee becomes effective, only the Divestiture Trustee shall have the right to sell the Divestiture Assets. The Divestiture Trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture to an Acquirer(s) acceptable to plaintiff United States, in its sole judgment upon consultation with any relevant plaintiff state, at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon reasonable effort by the Divestiture Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, and VI of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court deems appropriate. Subject to Section V.G of this Final Judgment, the Divestiture Trustee may hire at the cost and expense of defendants the Management Trustee appointed pursuant to the Preservation of Assets Stipulation and Order, and any investment bankers, attorneys or other agents, who shall be solely accountable to the Divestiture Trustee, reasonably necessary in the Divestiture Trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture.
E. In addition, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, plaintiff United States, in its sole discretion upon consultation with any relevant plaintiff state, may require defendants to include additional assets, or allow, with the written approval of plaintiff United States, defendants to substitute substantially similar assets, which substantially relate to the Wireless Business Divestiture Assets to be divested by the Divestiture Trustee to facilitate prompt divestiture to an acceptable Acquirer.
F. Defendants shall not object to a sale by the Divestiture Trustee on any ground other than the Divestiture Trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by defendants must be conveyed in writing to plaintiff United States, any relevant plaintiff state, and the Divestiture Trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the Divestiture Trustee has provided the notice required under Section VI.
G. The Divestiture Trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of defendants, on such terms and conditions as plaintiff United States approves, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the assets sold and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the Divestiture Trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the Divestiture Trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to defendants and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of the Divestiture Trustee and any professionals and agents retained by the Divestiture Trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the Divestiture Assets and based on a fee arrangement providing the Divestiture Trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture, and the speed with which it is accomplished, but timeliness is paramount.
H. Defendants shall use their best efforts to assist the Divestiture Trustee in accomplishing the required divestitures including their best efforts to effect all necessary regulatory approvals and will provide any necessary representations or warranties as appropriate related to sale of the Divestiture Assets. The Divestiture Trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the Divestiture Trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the business to be divested, and defendants shall develop financial and other information relevant to the assets to be divested as the Divestiture Trustee may reasonably request, subject to reasonable protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the Divestiture Trustee's accomplishment of the divestitures.
I. After its appointment, the Divestiture Trustee shall file monthly reports with plaintiff United States, any relevant plaintiff state, and the Court setting forth the Divestiture Trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestitures ordered under this Final Judgment. To the extent such reports contain information that the Divestiture Trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The Divestiture Trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the Divestiture Assets.
J. If the Divestiture Trustee has not accomplished such divestitures within six months after its appointment, the Divestiture Trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the Divestiture Trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestitures, (2) the reasons, in the Divestiture Trustee's judgment, why the required divestitures have not been accomplished, and (3) the Divestiture Trustee's recommendations. To the extent such reports contain information that the Divestiture Trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The Divestiture Trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the plaintiff United States and any relevant plaintiff state who shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the Divestiture Trustee's appointment by a period requested by plaintiff United States upon consultation with any relevant plaintiff state.
K. After defendants transfer the Divestiture Assets to the Divestiture Trustee, and until those Divestiture Assets have been divested to an Acquirer or Acquirers approved by plaintiff United States pursuant to Section IV.A and IV.H, the Divestiture Trustee shall have sole and complete authority to manage and operate the Divestiture Assets and to exercise the responsibilities of the licensee, and shall not be subject to any control or direction by defendants. Defendants shall not retain any economic interest in the Divestiture Assets transferred to the Divestiture Trustee, apart from the right to receive the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the Divestiture Assets.
L. The Divestiture Trustee shall operate the Wireless Business Divestiture Assets consistent with the Preservation of Assets Stipulation and Order and this Final Judgment, with control over operations, marketing and sales. Defendants shall not attempt to influence the business decisions of the Divestiture Trustee concerning the operation and management of the Wireless Business Divestiture Assets, and shall not communicate with the Divestiture Trustee concerning divestiture of the Divestiture Assets or take any action to influence, interfere with, or impede the Divestiture Trustee's accomplishment of the divestitures required by this Final Judgment, except that defendants may communicate with the Divestiture Trustee to the extent necessary for defendants to comply with this Final Judgment and to provide the Divestiture Trustee, if requested to do so, with whatever resources or cooperation may be required to complete divestiture of the Divestiture Assets and to carry out the requirements of the Preservation of Assets Stipulation and Order and this Final Judgment. Except as provided in this Final Judgment and the Preservation of Assets Stipulation and Order, in no event shall defendants provide to, or receive from, the Divestiture Trustee or the mobile wireless businesses under the Divestiture Trustee's control any non-public or competitively sensitive marketing, sales, or pricing information relating to their respective mobile wireless businesses.
VI. Notice of Proposed Divestitares
A. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, defendants or the Divestiture Trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestitures required herein, shall notify plaintiff United States and any relevant plaintiff state in writing of any proposed divestiture required by Section IV or V of this Final Judgment. If the Divestiture Trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestiture and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered or expressed an interest in or desire to acquire any ownership interest in the Divestiture Assets, together with full details of the same.
B. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by plaintiff United States and any relevant plaintiff state of such notice, plaintiff United States and any relevant plaintiff state may request from defendants, the proposed Acquirer or Acquirers, any other third party, or the Divestiture Trustee if applicable additional information concerning the proposed divestiture, the proposed Acquirer or Acquirers, and any other potential Acquirer. Defendants and the Divestiture Trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
C. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after plaintiff United States and any relevant plaintiff state have been provided the additional information requested from defendants, the proposed Acquirer or Acquirers, any third party, and the Divestiture Trustee, whichever is later, plaintiff United States, upon consultation with any relevant plaintiff state, shall provide written notice to defendants and the Divestiture Trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If plaintiff United States provides written notice that it does not object, the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to defendants' limited right to object to the sale under Section V.F of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that plaintiff United States does not object to the proposed Acquirer or upon objection by plaintiff United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or Section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by defendants under Section V.F, a divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VII. Financing
Defendants shall not finance all or any part of any divestiture made pursuant to Section IV or V of this Final Judgment.
VIII. Preservation of Assets

Defendants shall take no action that would jeopardize the divestitures ordered by this Court.
IX. Affidavits

Each such affidavit shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who during the preceding thirty (30) days, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts defendants have taken to solicit buyers for the Divestiture Assets, and to provide required information to prospective Acquirers, including the limitations, if any, on such information. Assuming the information set forth in the affidavit is true and complete, any objection by plaintiff United States, after consultation with any relevant plaintiff state, to information provided by defendants, including limitation on information, shall be made within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such affidavit.
B. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, defendants shall deliver to plaintiff United States and any relevant plaintiff state an affidavit that describes in reasonable detail all actions defendants have taken and all steps defendants have implemented on an ongoing basis to comply with Section VIII of this Final Judgment. Defendants shall deliver to plaintiff United States and any relevant plaintiff state an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in defendants' earlier affidavits provided pursuant to this section within fifteen (15) calendar days after the change is implemented.
C. Defendants shall keep all records of all efforts made to preserve and divest the Divestiture Assets until one year after such divestitures have been completed.

B. Upon the written request of a duly authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, defendants shall submit written reports, under oath if requested, relating to any of the matters contained in this Final Judgment as may be requested.
C. No information or documents obtained by the means provided in this section shall be divulged by plaintiff United States to any person other than an authorized representative of the executive branch of the United States or, pursuant to a customary protective Order or waiver of confidentiality by defendants, the FCC, except in the course of legal proceedings to which the United States is a party (including grand jury proceedings), or for the purpose of securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or as otherwise required by law.
D. If at the time information or documents are furnished by defendants to plaintiff United States, defendants represent and identify in writing the material in any such information or documents to which a claim of protection may be asserted under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and defendants mark each pertinent page of such material, ""Subject to claim of protection under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,"" then plaintiff United States shall give defendants ten (10) calendar days notice prior to divulging such material in any legal proceeding (other than a grand jury proceeding).

AND WHEREAS, the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Kentucky have concluded, after due investigation and careful consideration of the relevant circumstances, including the claims asserted in the Amended Complaint, and the legal and factual defenses thereto, that the public interest is served by entering into a Stipulation, to avoid the uncertainties of litigation and to assure that the benefits of this Final Judgment are obtained;

IV. DIVESTITURES
A. DFA is ordered and directed, within five days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, to divest the Divestiture Assets in a manner consistent with this Final Judgment to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion, after consultation with the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with the Commonwealth of Kentucky, may agree to an extension of this time period for any divestiture of up to thirty additional calendar days. DFA agrees to use its best efforts to divest the Divestiture Assets as expeditiously as possible.
B. DFA shall also use commercially reasonable effortsto cause AFLP to divest its interests in the Southern Belle Dairy to an acquirer acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion, after consultation with the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
C. In accomplishing the divestitures ordered by this Final Judgment, DFA promptly shall make known to one or more potential purchasersthe availability of the Divestiture Assets. DFA shall inform any potentially qualified purchasermaking inquiry regarding a possible purchase of the Divestiture Assets that such assets are being offered for sale.
D. DFA shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be furnished to all prospective Acquirers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information and documents relating to the Divestiture Assets and the Southern Belle Dairy customarily provided in a due diligence process except such information or documents subject to the attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product doctrine. DFA shall make available such information to the United States and the Commonwealth of Kentucky at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
E. DFA shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission forprospective Acquirers of the Divestiture Assets to have reasonable access to personnel and to make inspections of the physical facilities of the Southern Belle Dairy; access to any and all environmental, zoning, and other permit documents and information; and access to any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.
F. DFA shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be provided to the Acquirer and the United States information relating to the personnel involved in the operation of the Southern Belle Dairy to enable the Acquirer to make offers of employment. DFA shall not interfere with any negotiations by the Acquirer to employ any employee whose primary responsibility is the production, sale, marketing, or distribution of products from the Southern Belle Dairy.
G. DFA shall not take any action that will impede in any way the operation of the Southern Belle Dairy or the divestiture of the Divestiture Assets.
H. Unless the United States, in its sole discretion,after consultation with the Commonwealth of Kentucky,otherwise consents in writing, the divestiture pursuant to Section IV, or by trustee appointed pursuant to Section V, of this Final Judgment, shall include the entire Divestiture Assets and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with the Commonwealth of Kentucky, that the Southern Belle Dairy will be a viable, ongoing dairy.The divestiture, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V of this Final Judgment,
shall be made to an Acquirer that, in the United States' sole judgment, after consultation with the Commonwealth of Kentucky, has the intent and capability (including the necessary managerial, operational, technical and financial capability) of competing effectively in school and fluid milk markets in Kentucky and Tennessee; and
shall be accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion,after consultation with the Commonwealth of Kentucky, that none of the terms of any agreement between an Acquirer and DFA give DFA the ability unreasonably to raise the Acquirer's costs, to lower the Acquirer's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the Acquirer to compete effectively.
V. APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE
A. If DFA has not divested the Divestiture Assets within the time period specified in Section IV(A), DFA shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestiture of the Divestiture Assets.
B. After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the Divestiture Assets. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States (after consultation with the Commonwealth of Kentucky) at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, and VI of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court deems appropriate. Subject to Section V(D) of this Final Judgment, the trustee may hire at the cost and expense of DFA any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents, who shall be solely accountable to the trustee, reasonably necessary in the trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture.
C. DFA shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by DFA must be conveyed in writing to the United States and the trustee within ten calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VI.
D. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of DFA, on such terms and conditions as the United States approves, after consultation with the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to DFA and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of the trustee and any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the Divestiture Assets and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished, but timeliness is paramount.
E. DFA shall use its best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture. While the trustee shall have the right to sell the Divestiture Assets, DFA shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause AFLP to divest its interests in the Southern Belle Dairy to an acquirer acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion, after consultation with the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the business to be divested, and DFA shall develop financial and other information relevant to such business as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to reasonable protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. DFA shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture.
F. After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the United States, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, DFA, and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestiture ordered under this Final Judgment. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court and DFA's copy of the reports shall have such confidential information redacted. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the Divestiture Assets.
G. If the trustee has not accomplished such divestiture within six months after its appointment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture, (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestiture has not been accomplished, and (3) the trustee's recommendations. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the United States and the Commonwealth of Kentucky who shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The trustee shall at the same time furnish the report to DFA, but with all confidential information redacted. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
H. If necessary in the trustee's judgment to divest the Divestiture Assets, DFA shall use its best efforts to assist the trustee in dissolving the Southern Belle Dairy under Delaware Statute 6 Del. C. ยง 18-802, or such other applicable statutes and laws.
VI. NOTICE OF PROPOSED DIVESTITURES
A. Within two business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, DFA or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture required herein, shall notify the United States and the Commonwealth of Kentucky of the proposed divestiture required by Sections IV or V of this Final Judgment. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify DFA. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestiture and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered or expressed an interest in or desire to acquire any ownership interest in the Divestiture Assets, together with full details of the same.
B. Within fifteen calendar days of receipt by the United States of such notice, the United States may request from DFA, the proposed Acquirer, any other third party, or the trustee if applicable additional information concerning the proposed divestiture, the proposed Acquirer, and any other potential Acquirer. DFA and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
C. Within thirty calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty calendar days after the United States has been provided the additional information requested from DFA, the proposed Acquirer, any third party, and the trustee, whichever is later, the United States shall provide written notice to DFA and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States provides written notice that it does not object, the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to DFA's limited right to object to the sale under Section V(C) of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed Acquirer or upon objection by the United States, the divestiture proposed under Sections IV or Section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by DFA under Section V(C), the divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VII. FINANCING
DFA shall not finance all or any part of any purchase made pursuant to Section IV or V of this Final Judgment.
VIII. SUPPLY CONTRACTS
DFA shall not require the Acquirer to enter into a supply contract for raw milk with DFA as a condition for the sale of the Divestiture Assets.
IX. AFFIDAVITS
A. Within twenty calendar days of DFA's signing the Stipulation, and every thirty calendar days thereafter until the divestiture has been completed under Sections IV or V, DFA shall deliver to the United States an affidavit as to the fact and manner of its compliance with Section IV or V of this Final Judgment. Each such affidavit shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding thirty calendar days, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts DFA has taken to solicit buyers for the Divestiture Assets, and to provide required information to prospective purchasers, including the limitations, if any, on such information. Assuming the information set forth in the affidavit is true and complete, any objection by the United States to information provided by DFA, including limitation on information, shall be made within fourteen calendar days of receipt of such affidavit.
B. Within twenty calendar days of DFA's signing the Stipulation, DFA shall deliver to the United States an affidavit that describes in reasonable detail all actions DFA has taken and all steps DFA has implemented on an ongoing basis to comply with the Stipulation. DFA shall deliver to the United States an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in DFA's earlier affidavits filed pursuant to this section within fifteen calendar days after the change is implemented.
C. DFA shall keep all records of all efforts made to preserve and divest the Divestiture Assets until one year after such divestiture has been completed.
X. COMPLIANCE INSPECTION
A. For the purposes of determining or securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or of determining whether the Final Judgment should be modified or vacated, and subject to any legally recognized privilege, from time to time duly authorized representatives of the United States Department of Justice or the Commonwealth of Kentucky, including consultants and other persons retained by either of them, shall, upon written request of a duly authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division or the Attorney General for Kentucky, and on reasonable notice to DFA, be permitted:

D. If at the time information or documents are furnished by DFA to the plaintiffs, DFA represents and identifies in writing the material in any such information or documents to which a claim of protection may be asserted under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and DFA marks each pertinent page of such material, ""Subject to claim of protection under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,"" then the plaintiffs shall give DFA ten calendar days notice prior to divulging such material in any legal proceeding (other than a grand jury proceeding).

Data Card shall provide such information to plaintiff at the time it furnishes such information to any other person. Data Card also shall permit all bona fide prospective purchasers to have access to any and all personnel who have any responsibilities for the AFI 1500/1600 product line and to make such inspection of physical assets and any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information as may be relevant to the sale of the AFI 1500/1600 product line.
V.
A.          If Data Card has not accomplished the divestiture required by Section IV of this Final Judgment by November 1, 1986, the Court shall, upon application of plaintiff, appoint a trustee to divest the AFI 1500/1600 product line. Such appointment shall become effective on November 1, 1986 or as soon thereafter as the Court appoints the trustee. After the trustee's appointment becomes effective, only the trustee, and not Data Card, shall have the right to sell the AFI 1500/1600 product line. The trustee shall be a business broker or a member of the investment banking community with experience and expertise in acquisition and divestitures. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture at the best price then obtainable upon a reasonable effort by the trustee to a purchaser acceptable to plaintiff, subject to the provisions of Section VI of this Final Judgment. The trustee shall have such other powers as the Court deems appropriate. Data Card shall use all reasonable efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture. Data Card shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any grounds other than malfeasance. Any such objection by Data Card must be conveyed in writing to plaintiff and the trustee within fifteen (15) days after the trustee has notified Data Card of the proposed sale.
B.          If Data Card has not divested its ownership interest in the AFI 1500/1600 product line by October 1, 1986, Data Card shall notify plaintiff of the fact. If Data Card still has not divested all of its ownership interest in the AFI 1500/1600 product line within five (5) days thereafter, plaintiff shall provide Data Card with written notice of the names and qualifications of not more than two (2) nominees for the position of trustee for the required divestiture. Data Card will notify plaintiff within five (5) days thereafter whether either or both of such nominees are acceptable.

The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of Data Card, and Data Card shall develop such financial and other information relevant to the assets to be divested as the trustee may request. Data Card shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture.
E.          After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the parties and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish divestiture as contemplated under this Final Judgment. If the trustee has not accomplished such divestiture within ten (10) months after the trustee's appointment, the trustee shall thereupon promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture, (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestiture has not been accomplished, and (3) the trustee's recommendations. The trustee at the same time shall furnish such report to the parties, who shall each have the right to be heard and to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the trust, which shall include, if necessary, extending the term of the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment.

Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice of the proposed divestiture, plaintiff may request from Data Card and the proposed purchaser additional information concerning the proposed divestiture. Data Card shall furnish the additional information requested from it within twenty (20) days of the receipt of the request, unless plaintiff shall agree to extend the time. Until plaintiff certifies in writing that it is satisfied that both Data Card and the proposed purchaser have provided the additional information requested from them, the divestiture shall not be consummated. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) days after receipt of the additional information from Data Card and the proposed purchaser, whichever is later, unless Data Card shall agree to extend the time, plaintiff shall notify in writing Data Card and the trustee, if there is one, if it objects to the proposed divestiture. If plaintiff fails to object within the period specified, or if plaintiff notifies in writing Data Card and the trustee, if there is one, that it does not object, the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to Data Card's right to object to the sale under the proviso in Section V.A. of this Final Judgment. Upon objection by plaintiff, a divestiture proposed under Section IV of this Final Judgment shall not be consummated. Upon objection by plaintiff, a divestiture proposed under Section V of this Final Judgment shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.

This Final Judgment shall not be evidence against or an admission by any party of any issue of fact or law, nor a determination that any violation of law has occurred. Therefore, before the taking of any trial testimony and without trial of any issue of fact or law, and upon consent of the parties, it is
ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED, as follows:
I.
JURISDICTION
This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action and over each of the consenting parties. The Complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted against Delta under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1.

maintaining, adopting, or enforcing any Most Favored Nation Clause or similar provision in any Participating Dentist's Agreement, or by any other means or methods;

This Court finds that this Final Judgment is in the public interest as it effectively eliminates the Most Favored Nation Clause. For the reasons set forth in the Competitive Impact Statement, which is attached, eliminating the Most Favored Nation Clause dismantles a significant barrier to the entry of new dental insurance plans into the Rhode Island market. This Final Judgment will open the Rhode Island market to other dental insurance plans, which ultimately should provide Rhode Island consumers with increased dental insurance options.

Civil Action No. 99-005 (SLR)


FINAL JUDGMENT
Plaintiff, the United States of America, filed its Complaint on January 5, 1999. Defendant, Dentsply International, Inc., appeared and filed its Answer on January 20, 1999. This Court, having jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter, conducted a trial and entered findings of fact and conclusions of law on August 8, 2003. On May 26, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued its mandate in this case. Pursuant to that mandate, judgment is hereby entered in favor of plaintiff United States of America and against Dentsply International, Inc., and it is further ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED as follows:
I. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
A. Dentsply shall not condition the sale of its teeth or any other product to a dealer, or authorize a person as a dealer of Dentsply teeth, based on that dealer's sale of non-Dentsply teeth or that dealer's consideration to sell non-Dentsply teeth.
B. Dentsply shall not take, or threaten to take, any of the following retaliatory or deterrent actions against a dealer based on that dealer's sale of non-Dentsply teeth or that dealer's consideration to sell non-Dentsply teeth:
terminating that dealer as an authorized dealer of Dentsply's teeth or other products;
selling teeth or other products to that dealer on terms or conditions less favorable than those offered to other dealers;
providing less training, education, marketing, promotion, or other support to that dealer than is provided to other dealers;
encouraging or influencing any customer of that dealer to buy Dentsply teeth or other products from a different dealer, except in response to that dealer selling a competitive tooth to such customer and that dealer not offering to the customer a Dentsply offer to meet the competitive tooth offering;
selling teeth or other products directly to any customer of that dealer; or
authorizing a new dealer of Dentsply's teeth or other products solely for the purpose of selling to any customer of that dealer.
C. Dentsply shall not require any dealer to be, or agree with any dealer that it will become, an exclusive Dentsply tooth dealer, or offer market-share discounts to any dealer.
D. Dentsply shall remove Dealer Criterion 6 from its list of requirements for dealers to be recognized and maintained as authorized Dentsply tooth dealers. Within thirty days of this Final Judgment taking effect, Dentsply shall distribute to each dealer selling Dentsply teeth:
its revised dealer criteria, which shall comply with the terms of this Final Judgment; and
a copy of this Final Judgment.
Dentsply shall promptly provide its dealer criteria and a copy of this Final Judgment to any tooth dealer it authorizes, or prospective tooth dealer it negotiates with, after this Final Judgment takes effect. Dentsply shall apply and enforce its dealer criteria in a non-discriminatory manner.
E. Nothing in this Final Judgment shall prohibit Dentsply from taking any of the following actions:
terminating any or all of its dealers if it does so solely as part of a plan to modify its distribution scheme for artificial teeth and/or other dental products, and only if the dealers that are terminated as part of that plan are selected for termination for reasons not based on their sale of non-Dentsply teeth and/or their consideration to sell non-Dentsply teeth. Dentsply shall not threaten any dealer with the implementation of such a plan for the purpose of deterring that dealer from selling non-Dentsply teeth; or
offering volume discounts or prompt-payment discounts or incentives for increased sales of Dentsply teeth to its dealers, as long as such discounts and incentives are publicized and offered to all tooth dealers on a uniform basis and without regard to whether such dealers sell, or are considering selling, non-Dentsply teeth.
F. Dentsply shall not terminate any authorized dealer of its teeth or artificial tooth related products, without providing in writing to the Plaintiff and the dealer, at least sixty days before termination, where feasible, and no later than 14 days before termination in extenuating circumstances, a detailed description of the reasons for the termination. Dentsply's Antitrust Compliance Officer shall certify that the description fully reflects all of the reasons for termination and that the termination would not violate this Final Judgment. Dentsply may not use a decline in a dealer's sales of Dentsply teeth as a basis for termination if that dealer also sells non-Dentsply teeth, unless the dealer's purchases of Dentsply teeth fall below $200,000 per year or the decline in the dealer's purchases of Dentsply teeth is greater than fifty percent (50%) of the dealer's prior year's purchases. Dentsply shall have the right to seek permission from Plaintiff to terminate an authorized dealer of its teeth or artificial tooth related products that also sells non-Dentsply teeth, for a decline in the dealer's purchases of teeth from Dentsply which is less than fifty percent (50%) of the dealer's prior year's purchases, provided Dentsply shall not terminate such dealer unless and until it receives written permission from Plaintiff.
G. Unless authorized to do so by an order from this Court, Plaintiff shall not disclose any information or documents obtained by the means provided in Section I (F) to any person other than a duly authorized representative of the Executive Branch of the United States, except in the course of legal proceedings to which the United States is a party, including grand jury proceedings, or for the purpose of securing compliance with this Final Judgment. In the event that Plaintiff intends to seek such authorization from this Court, it shall provide to Dentsply reasonable prior notice of production of the materials so that Dentsply can seek a Protective Order if it deems necessary.
II. COMPLIANCE PROGRAM
A. Dentsply shall designate, within thirty days after this Final Judgment takes effect, an Antitrust Compliance Officer with responsibility for implementing an antitrust compliance program for the purpose of ensuring full compliance with this Final Judgment.
B. The Antitrust Compliance Officer shall:
within sixty days after this Final Judgment takes effect, provide a copy of this Final Judgment to each of Dentsply's directors and officers, and to each employee whose job responsibilities relate in any way to the marketing or sale of teeth or any other product to dealers;
distribute in a timely manner a copy of this Final Judgment to any person who succeeds to, or subsequently holds, a position of director or officer or an employee whose job responsibilities relate in any way to the marketing or sale of teeth or any other product to dealers; and
within sixty days after this Final Judgment takes effect, develop and implement the procedures necessary to ensure Dentsply's compliance with this Final Judgment. Such procedures shall ensure that questions from any Dentsply director, officer, or employee about this Final Judgment can be answered by counsel as the need arises.
III. CERTIFICATION
A. Within seventy-five days after this Final Judgment takes effect, Dentsply shall certify to the Plaintiff whether it has: (1) designated an Antitrust Compliance Officer and identify the person so designated; (2) distributed the Final Judgment in accordance with Section II (B)(1); (3) developed the procedures required by Section II (B)(3); and (4) distributed its revised dealer criteria in accordance with Section I (D).
B. Dentsply shall certify annually, from the first anniversary date of this Final Judgment taking effect until this Final Judgment expires, to Plaintiff that it has complied with the provisions of this Final Judgment.
IV. PLAINTIFF'S ACCESS
A. For the purposes of determining or securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or determining whether it should be modified or vacated, and subject to any legally recognized privilege, authorized representatives of the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, upon written request of a duly authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, and on reasonable notice to Dentsply, shall be permitted:

to interview, either informally or on the record, Dentsply's directors, officers, employees, or agents, who may have individual counsel present, concerning such matters; and
to obtain written reports from Dentsply, under oath if requested, relating to any matters contained in this Final Judgment.
B. Dentsply shall have the right to be represented by counsel in any proceeding under this Section IV.
C. No information or documents obtained by the means provided in this Section IV shall be divulged by the Plaintiff to any person other than a duly authorized representative of the Executive Branch of the United States, except in the course of legal proceedings to which the United States is a party, including grand jury proceedings, or for the purpose of securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or as otherwise required by law.
D. If at the time information or documents are furnished by Dentsply to the Plaintiff, Dentsply represents in writing that certain material is entitled to confidentiality protection under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and identifies the confidential information by marking each pertinent page of such material, ""Subject to claim of protection under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,"" then the Plaintiff shall use its best efforts to give ten days' notice to Dentsply prior to divulging such material in any legal proceeding (other than a grand jury proceeding) to which Dentsply is not a party.
E. Dentsply shall have the right to claim protection from public disclosure, under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.ยง552, or any other applicable law or regulation, for any material submitted to the Plaintiff under this Final Judgment. After appropriate consideration of such claim of protection, the Plaintiff will either assert that the material is protected from disclosure under law or give such defendant ten calendar days notice of its intent to disclose the material.
V. APPLICABILITY

B. Defendants shall require, as a condition of the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of their assets or of lesser business units that include the Geneva Production Facility or the Battle Mountain Production Facility, that the purchaser agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Final Judgment, provided, however, that defendants need not obtain such an agreement from the Acquirer.
IV. Divestiture
A. Defendant DNH is ordered and directed, within ninety (90) calendar days after the filing of the Complaint in this matter, or five (5) days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to divest the Geneva Production Asset in a manner consistent with this Final Judgment to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion. The United States, in its sole discretion, may agree to one or more extensions of this time period, not to exceed in total sixty (60) calendar days, and shall notify the Court in each such circumstance. Defendant DNH agrees to use its best efforts to divest the Geneva Production Asset as expeditiously as possible.
B. In accomplishing the divestiture ordered by this Final Judgment, defendant DNH promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of the Geneva Production Asset. Defendants shall inform any person making inquiry regarding a possible purchase of the Geneva Production Asset that it will be divested pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide that person with a copy of this Final Judgment. Defendant DNH shall offer to furnish to all prospective Acquirers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information and documents relating to the Geneva Production Asset customarily provided in a due diligence process except such information or documents subject to the attorney-client or work-product privilege. Defendant DNH shall make available such information to the United States at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
C. Defendant DNH shall provide prospective Acquirers of the Geneva Production Asset and the United States information relating to the personnel involved in the production, operation, development, and sale of the Geneva Production Asset to enable the Acquirer to make offers of employment. Defendants will not interfere with any negotiations by the Acquirer to employ any of defendant DNH's employees whose responsibilities includes the production, operation, development, or sale of the products of the Geneva Production Asset.
D. Defendant DNH shall permit prospective Acquirers of the Geneva Production Asset to have reasonable access to personnel and to make inspections of the physical facilities of the Geneva Production Asset; access to any and all environmental, zoning, and other permit documents and information; and access to any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.
E. Defendant DNH shall warrant to the Acquirer of the Geneva Production Asset that each asset therein that was operational as of the date of filing of the Complaint in this matter will be operational on the date of divestiture.
F. Defendants shall not take any action that will impede in any way the permitting, operation, or divestiture of the Geneva Production Asset.
G. Defendant DNH shall warrant to the Acquirer of the Geneva Production Asset that there are no material defects in the environmental, zoning, or other permits pertaining to the operation of the Geneva Production Asset, and following the sale of the Geneva Production Asset, defendants shall not undertake, directly or indirectly, any challenges to the environmental, zoning, or other permits relating to the operation of the Geneva Production Asset.
H. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, the divestiture pursuant to Section IV, or by trustee appointed pursuant to Section V, of this Final Judgment, shall include the entire Geneva Production Asset or, alternatively, pursuant to Section V(B), the entire Battle Mountain Production Asset, and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that the divested asset can and will be used by the Acquirer as part of a viable, ongoing business engaged in the manufacture and sale of IGAN. Divestiture of the Geneva Production Asset or, alternatively, the Battle Mountain Production Asset may be made to an Acquirer, provided that it is demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of the United States that the divested asset will remain viable and the divestiture of such asset will remedy the competitive harm alleged in the Complaint. The divestitures, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V of this Final Judgment,
Shall be made to an Acquirer that, in the United States' sole judgment, has the managerial, operational, and financial capability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of IGAN; and
Shall be accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that none of the terms of any agreement between an Acquirer and defendants give defendants the ability unreasonably to raise the Acquirer's costs, to lower the Acquirer's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the Acquirer to compete effectively.
V. Appointment of Trustee to Effect Divestiture
A. If defendant DNH has not divested the Geneva Production Asset within the time period specified in Section IV(A), it shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestiture of the Geneva Production Asset.
B. After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the Geneva Production Asset. Should the trustee determine that a sale of the Geneva Production Asset cannot be expeditiously accomplished, the trustee shall notify the United States and the parties of its conclusion and the reasons supporting its conclusion. Upon receipt of such notice from the trustee, the United States, in its sole discretion, shall have the right to direct the trustee to sell the Battle Mountain Production Asset as an alternative to the Geneva Production Asset. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture of the Geneva Production Asset or, should the United States so direct, the Battle Mountain Production Asset to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, and VI of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court deems appropriate. Subject to Section V(D) of this Final Judgment, the trustee may hire at the cost and expense of defendant DNH any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents, who shall be solely accountable to the trustee, reasonably necessary in the trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture.
C. Defendants shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by defendants must be conveyed in writing to the United States and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VI.
D. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of defendant DNH, on such terms and conditions as plaintiff approves, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the Geneva Production Asset or, alternatively, the Battle Mountain Production Asset, and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to defendant DNH and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of the trustee and any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the asset to be divested and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished, but timeliness is paramount.
E. Defendants shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the business to be divested, and defendants shall develop financial and other information relevant to such business as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to customary confidentiality protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture.
F. After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the United States and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestiture ordered under this Final Judgment. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Geneva Production Asset or, alternatively, the Battle Mountain Production Asset, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest either asset.
G. If the trustee has not accomplished such divestiture within six months after its appointment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture; (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestiture has not been accomplished; and (3) the trustee's recommendations. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the plaintiff who shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VI. Notice of Proposed Divestiture
A. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, defendant DNH or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture required herein, shall notify the United States of any proposed divestiture required by Section IV or V of this Final Judgment. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestiture and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered or expressed an interest in or desire to acquire any ownership interest in the Geneva Production Asset or, alternatively, the Battle Mountain Production Asset, together with full details of the same.
B. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the United States of such notice, the United States may request from defendants, the proposed Acquirer, any other third party, or the trustee if applicable additional information concerning the proposed divestiture, the proposed Acquirer, and any other potential Acquirer. Defendants and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
C. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after the United States has been provided the additional information requested from defendants, the proposed Acquirer, any third party, and the trustee, whichever is later, the United States shall provide written notice to defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States provides written notice that it does not object, the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to defendants' limited right to object to the sale under Section V(C) of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed Acquirer or upon objection by the United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or Section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by defendants under Section V(C), a divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VII. Financing
Defendants shall not finance all or any part of any purchase made pursuant to Section IV or V of this Final Judgment.
VIII. Hold Separate
Until the divestiture required by this Final Judgment has been accomplished, defendants shall take all steps necessary to comply with the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered by this Court. Defendants shall take no action that would jeopardize the divestiture ordered by this Court.

Defendant need not obtain such an agreement from the Acquirer of the assets divested pursuant to this Final Judgment.
IV. DIVESTITURE
Defendant is ordered and directed, within sixty (60) calendar days after the filing of the Complaint in this matter, or five (5) calendar days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to divest the Divestiture Assets in a manner consistent with this Final Judgment to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with the Plaintiff States. The United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with the Plaintiff States, may agree to one or more extensions of this time period not to exceed sixty (60) calendar days in total, and shall notify the Court in such circumstances. Defendant agrees to use its best efforts to divest the Divestiture Assets as expeditiously as possible.
In accomplishing the divestiture ordered by this Final Judgment, Defendant promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of the Divestiture Assets. Defendant shall inform any person making inquiry regarding a possible purchase of the Divestiture Assets that they are being divested pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide that person with a copy of this Final Judgment. Defendant shall offer to furnish to any prospective Acquirer, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information and documents relating to the Divestiture Assets customarily provided in a due diligence process, except such information or documents subject to the attorney-client privilege or work-product doctrine. Defendant shall make available such information to the United States at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
Defendant shall provide the Acquirer and the United States information relating to its current and former employees involved in the use, operation, certification, design, production, modification, enhancement, distribution, sale, repair or service of the Premier Voting Equipment System Products and/or Premier's use of the AutoMARK Products to enable the Acquirer to make offers of employment to such personnel. Defendant shall not interfere with any negotiations by the Acquirer to employ any such employee whose primary responsibility is the use, operation, certification, design, production, modification, enhancement, distribution, sale, repair or service of the Premier Voting Equipment System Products and/or Premier's use of the AutoMARK Products.
Defendant shall waive all nondisclosure and noncompete agreements for all of the current and former employees of Premier for a period of six (6) months following the date of the divestiture of the Divestiture Assets, for the exclusive purpose of allowing those employees to seek employment with the Acquirer.
Defendant shall permit any prospective Acquirer of the Divestiture Assets to have reasonable access to personnel involved in the use, operation, certification, design, production, modification, enhancement, distribution, sale, repair or service of the Premier Voting Equipment System Products and/or the AutoMARK Products, and access to any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.
At the option of the Acquirer, Defendant shall enter into a contract for the purchase of additional parts and inventory for up to two (2) years sufficient to meet the Acquirer's needs to assemble, manufacture, produce, service or repair the Premier Voting Equipment System Products. The terms and conditions of any sale or contractual arrangement intended to satisfy this provision must be commercially reasonable.
In addition, Defendant shall provide any Acquirer of the Divestiture Assets information relating to suppliers of parts and components used for the assembly, manufacture, production, repair or service of the Premier Voting Equipment System Products and the AutoMARK Products. Defendant shall not interfere with the Acquirer's ability to contract for the supply of parts or components from any vendor.
Defendant shall immediately provide any Acquirer with a list of all current and former customers for the Premier Voting Equipment System Products.
To the extent that current Premier contracts prevent Premier customers from selecting the Acquirer as its provider of equipment or services related to the Premier Voting Equipment System Products, the Defendant agrees to waive any such contractual impediment at the option of the customer.
At the option of the Acquirer, Defendant shall enter into a transition services agreement sufficient to meet the Acquirer's needs for assistance in the use, operation, certification, design, production, modification, enhancement, distribution, sale, repair or service of the Premier Voting Equipment System Products and/or the AutoMARK Products for a period of up to six (6) months. The terms and conditions of any contractual arrangement intended to satisfy this provision must be commercially reasonable.
On the date of the sale of the Divestiture Assets, Defendant shall provide Acquirer with copies of contracts with all current and former customers for any of the Premier Voting Equipment System Products.
The Acquirer shall grant Defendant a non-exclusive license to use the Premier Voting Equipment System Products and the assets described in II(E)(2)(A), but Defendant may not use such a license to attempt to compete for any opportunity to sell or lease Premier Voting Equipment System Products contained within a Request for Proposal (or RFP) or a Request for Quote (or RFQ) for a voting equipment system, or any upgrade, request or order that calls for replacement of 50 percent or more of a customer's installed voting equipment, other than in the case of a force majeure event (i.e., Act of God, fire, earthquake, flood, explosion, war, or terrorist act), or to the extent the Defendant is obligated under a contract with a Premier or Diebold customer in existence at the time of Closing, or to the extent that the Defendant is obligated under a settlement agreement formed by Diebold pursuant to Section 4.2(d) of the Diebold Purchase Agreement. Subject to the limitations described in Section IV, Defendant may use the license described in this paragraph to provide equipment and services to current customers.
Any improvement or modification to the Divestiture Assets developed by either Defendant or the Acquirer shall be owned solely by the developing party.
Defendant shall not take any action that will impede in any way the operation or divestiture of the Divestiture Assets.
Unless the United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with the Plaintiff States, otherwise consents in writing, the divestiture pursuant to Section IV, or by trustee appointed pursuant to Section V, of this Final Judgment shall include the entire Divestiture Assets, and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with the Plaintiff States, that the Divestiture Assets can and will be used by the Acquirer as part of a viable, ongoing business that is engaged in the provision of voting equipment systems and services. The divestiture, whether pursuant to Section IV or Section V of this Final Judgment:
shall be made to an Acquirer that, in the United State's sole judgment, after consultation with the Plaintiff States, has the intent and capability (including the necessary managerial, operational, technical and financial capability) of competing effectively in the provision of voting equipment systems and services; and
shall be accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with the Plaintiff States, that none of the terms of any agreement between an Acquirer and Defendant gives Defendant the ability unreasonably to raise the Acquirer's costs, to lower the Acquirer's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the Acquirer to compete effectively.
V. APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE
If Defendant has not divested the Divestiture Assets within the time period specified in Section IV(A), it shall notify the United States of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States and approved by the Court to effect the divestiture of the Divestiture Assets.
After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell the Divestiture Assets. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with the Plaintiff States, at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, and VI of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court deems appropriate. Subject to Section V(D) of this Final Judgment, the trustee may hire at the cost and expense of Defendant any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents, who shall be solely accountable to the trustee, reasonably necessary in the trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture.
Defendant shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by Defendant must be conveyed in writing to the United States and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VI.
The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of Defendant, on such terms and conditions as the United States approves, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to Defendant and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of the trustee and any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the Divestiture Assets and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished, but timeliness is paramount.
Defendant shall use its best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the business to be divested, and Defendant shall develop financial and other information relevant to such business as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to reasonable protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Defendant shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture.
After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the United States, the Plaintiff States, and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestiture ordered under this Final Judgment. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest the Divestiture Assets.
If the trustee has not accomplished the divestiture ordered under this Final Judgment within six (6) months after its appointment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth: (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture; (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestiture has not been accomplished; and (3) the trustee's recommendations. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the United States and the Plaintiff States, which shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VI. NOTICE OF PROPOSED DIVESTITURE
Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, Defendant shall notify the United States, and the Plaintiff States, of any proposed divestiture required by Section IV of this Final Judgment. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, the trustee shall notify the United States of any proposed divestiture required by Section V of this Final Judgment. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestiture and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered or expressed an interest in or desire to acquire any ownership interest in the Divestiture Assets, together with full details of the same.
Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the United States and the Plaintiff States of such notice, the United States and any Plaintiff State may request from Defendant, the proposed Acquirer, any other third party, or the trustee if applicable, additional information concerning the proposed divestiture, the proposed Acquirer, and any other potential Acquirer. Defendant and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after the United States has been provided the additional information requested from Defendant, the proposed Acquirer, any third party, and the trustee, whichever is later, the United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with the Plaintiff States, shall provide written notice to Defendant and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States, after consultation with the Plaintiff States, provides written notice that it does not object, the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to Defendant's limited right to object to the sale under Section V(C) of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed Acquirer or upon objection by the United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or Section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by Defendant under Section V(C), a divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.

Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts Defendant have taken to solicit buyers for the Divestiture Assets, and to provide required information to prospective Acquirers, including the limitations, if any, on such information. Assuming the information set forth in the affidavit is true and complete, any objection by the United States, after consultation with the Plaintiff States, to information provided by Defendant, including limitation on information, shall be made within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such affidavit.
Within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the Complaint in this matter, Defendant shall deliver to the United States an affidavit that describes in reasonable detail all actions it has taken and all steps Defendant has implemented on an ongoing basis to comply with Section VIII of this Final Judgment. Defendant shall deliver to the United States, the Plaintiff States, an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in Defendant's earlier affidavits filed pursuant to this section within fifteen (15) calendar days after the change is implemented.
Defendant shall keep all records of all efforts made to preserve and divest the Divestiture Assets until one year after such divestiture has been completed.

2. Enova may structure its requests for bids to require reasonable easements, licenses, and other arrangements for the continued operation of Common Facilities by Enova.
3. Before Enova can accept a bid by a potential purchaser received under the Auction Procedures with respect to any of the Divestiture Assets to be divested, the bid must be screened by the United States as specified in this section. Enova shall provide to the United States copies of all bids and any other documents submitted by any potential purchaser pursuant to the Auction Procedures. The United States shall have thirty days from the date it receives a copy of a bid to notify Enova that the potential bid is unacceptable with respect to any of the Divestiture Assets specified in the bid; provided, however, the United States may extend the thirty-day review period for any such bid for one additional thirty-day period by providing written notice to Enova; provided further, in all cases the period for review of potential bids by the United States shall expire no later than the earlier of five days prior to the date set by the CPUC for submission of the proposed winning bid by Enova or the thirty-day period (with one possible thirty-day extension) described above. If the United States does not notify Enova that a proposed bid is unacceptable within the applicable time period specified above, the purchaser making such bid shall be deemed acceptable by the United States with respect to all of the Divestiture Assets specified in that bid. The United States shall base its review of all potential bids screened pursuant to this paragraph solely on the criteria identified in Section IV(I) of this Final Judgment. The United States shall take all appropriate and necessary steps to keep the information received pursuant to this section confidential.
E. Timing.
1. Enova shall submit applications for authorization and approval of the auctions specified in Paragraph IV(B) above for the Divestiture Assets no later than ninety days after notice of entry of this Final Judgment.
2. Enova shall complete the sale of the Divestiture Assets as soon as practical after the receipt of all necessary governmental approvals; provided, however, if the sale of any of the Divestiture Assets is not completed within eighteen months after the date of the entry of this Final Judgment, a trustee shall be appointed pursuant to Section VI of this Final Judgment to effect the divestiture of any unsold assets; provided further, the United States may extend the eighteen-month period by six months by serving written notice on Enova prior to the expiration of the eighteen-month period; provided further, Enova and the United States may by mutual agreement extend further the time in which any of the Divestiture Assets shall be sold.
F. In accomplishing the divestiture ordered by this Final Judgment, Defendant promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of the Divestiture Assets. The California Auction Procedures shall be deemed to satisfy this requirement. Defendant shall inform any person making an inquiry regarding a possible purchase that the sale is being made pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide such person with a copy of this Final Judgment. Defendant shall make known to any person making an inquiry regarding a possible purchase of the Divestiture Assets that the assets defined in Section II(F) are being offered for sale. Defendant shall also offer to furnish to all bona fide prospective purchasers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information regarding the Divestiture Assets customarily provided in a due diligence process except such information subject to attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product privilege. Defendant shall make available such information to Plaintiff at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
G. Defendant shall not interfere with any negotiations by any purchaser to employ any employee of the Defendant necessary to the operation of Divestiture Assets.
H. Defendant, shall, at minimum, permit prospective purchasers of the Divestiture Assets to have reasonable access to personnel and to make such inspection of the Divestiture Assets, and any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.
I. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, the divestiture or divestitures pursuant to this section, or by the trustee appointed pursuant to Section VI of this Final Judgment, shall include the Divestiture Assets as specified in this Final Judgment (though not necessarily all to the same purchaser) and be accomplished by selling or otherwise conveying the Divestiture Assets to a purchaser or purchasers in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that none of the terms of any agreement between any purchaser and Defendant give Defendant the ability unreasonably to raise the purchaser's costs, to lower the purchaser's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the purchaser to compete effectively in the provision of electricity in California; provided, however, the purchaser need not continue operation of these assets.
V. ACQUISITION
A. General Prohibitions.
1. Defendant is enjoined from acquiring California Generation Facilities without prior notice to and approval of the United States. Such prior approval shall be within the sole discretion of the United States.
2. Defendant is enjoined from entering into any contracts that allow Defendant to control any California Generation Facilities without prior notice to and approval of the United States. Such prior approval shall be within the sole discretion of the United States.
B. Limitations on Prohibitions.
1. Acquisition cap--Defendant may acquire or control California Generation Facilities without prior approval of the United States if Defendant does not own or control, in the aggregate, more than 500 MW of capacity of California Generation Facilities. The capacity of Defendant's existing nuclear generation assets are excluded from the calculation of whether the 500 MW cap has been reached so long as the prices Enova receives for electricity generated by the existing nuclear generation assets are fixed by law or regulation. The Portland General Electric Contract capacity (75 MW) shall be included in the calculation of whether the 500 MW cap has been reached (reducing the total available to 425 MW), unless and until the Portland General Electric Contract terminates or is divested. The capacity of the Divestiture Assets shall be included in the calculation of whether the 500 MW cap has been reached, as long as Defendant owns such assets.
2. Acquisitions above the cap--In any event, the Defendant may acquire or control, California Generation Facilities in excess of 500 MW, subject to the prior approval of the United States as provided in Paragraphs V(A)(1) and V(A)(2).
C. Exceptions.
1. Outside California--Defendant may own, operate, control, or acquire any electricity generation facilities other than California Generation Facilities.
2. Cogeneration facilities--Defendant may own, operate, or control any cogeneration or renewable generation facilities in California.
3. Tolling agreements--Defendant may enter into tolling and reverse tolling agreements with any electricity generation facilities in California, provided Defendant does not control such facilities; provided further, that all such tolling and reverse tolling agreements include the following provision: ""In accordance with the Final Judgment in United States v. Enova Corporation, entered on [date], Enova's successors and their affiliates shall not have any ability to set the level of output of this electricity generation facility.""
4. California Public Power Generation Management Services Contracts--Defendant's entry into California Public Power Generation Management Services Contracts is not prohibited under Section V(A)(2) above, regardless of whether the contract allows for Defendant to exercise control of such facilities, and such contracts shall not be included in the calculation of whether the Acquisition Cap in Section V(B)(1) has been reached; provided however, Defendant may not enter into California Public Power Generation Management Services Contracts that allow the Defendant to exercise control of such facilities, without notice to the United States.
5. Notification of California Public Power Generation Management Services Contracts--Unless such transaction is otherwise subject to the reporting and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, 15 U.S.C.A. ยง 18a (West 1997) (""HSR Act""), for each California Public Power Generation Management Services Contract it enters for which notice is required, Defendant shall provide notice thereof to the United States as follows:
a. Notification shall be provided within five days of acceptance of the contract, and shall include copies of all contracts, the names of the principal representatives of the parties to the agreement who negotiated the agreement, and any management or strategic plans discussing the California Public Power Generation Management Services Contract that was the subject of the transaction.
b. This Section shall be broadly construed and any ambiguity or uncertainty regarding the filing of notice under this Section shall be resolved in favor of filing notice.
D. Methods of Obtaining Prior Approvals and of Providing Notice--Defendant shall obtain prior approval and provide notice by sending the required materials to Chief, Transportation, Energy, and Agriculture Section, Antitrust Division, United States Department of Justice, 325 Seventh Street, N.W., Suite 500, Washington, DC 20004.
E. Other Legal Requirements--Nothing in this section limits the Defendant's responsibility to comply with the requirements of the HSR Act, with respect to any acquisition.
VI. APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE
A. In the event that Defendant has not divested all of the Divestiture Assets within the time specified in Section IV of this Final Judgment, the Court shall appoint, on application of the United States, a trustee selected by the United States to effect the divestiture of the assets.
B. At or anytime after the appointment of the trustee, if either party believes a conflict may exist between this Final Judgment and an order of the CPUC relating to the Divestiture Assets, that party may move the Court for a resolution of the conflict in light of the status of any relevant CPUC proceeding and the purpose of this Final Judgment.
C. After the appointment of the trustee becomes effective, the trustee shall have the right to sell the Divestiture Assets. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture at the best price then obtainable upon a reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections VI and VII of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as the Court shall deem appropriate. Subject to Section VI(D) of this Final Judgment, the trustee shall have the power and authority to hire at the cost and expense of Defendant any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents reasonably necessary in the judgment of the trustee to assist in the divestiture, and such professionals and agents shall be accountable solely to the trustee. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture at the earliest possible time to a purchaser acceptable to the United States, in its sole judgment. Defendant shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any grounds other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by Defendant must be conveyed in writing to Plaintiff and the trustee no later than ten calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VII of this Final Judgment.
D. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of Defendant, on such terms and conditions as the Court may prescribe, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of the assets sold by the trustee and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to Enova and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of such trustee and of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the Divestiture Assets and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished.
E. After the appointment of the trustee becomes effective, Defendant shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the required divestiture, and shall use its best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture, including best efforts to effect all necessary regulatory approvals. Subject to a customary confidentiality agreement, the trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities related to the Divestiture Assets, and Defendant shall develop such financial or other information relevant to the Divestiture Assets to be divested customarily provided in a due diligence process as the trustee may reasonably request. Defendant shall permit prospective purchasers of the Divestiture Assets to have access to personnel and to make such inspection of physical facilities and any and all financial, operational or other documents and information as may be relevant to the divestiture required by this Final Judgment.
F. After the appointment of the trustee becomes effective, the trustee shall file monthly reports with Defendant, the United States, and the Court, setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish divestiture of the Divestiture Assets as contemplated under this Final Judgment; provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in the Divestiture Assets, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. Defendant may request that information in such reports that has been provided as confidential by the Defendant be deemed confidential by the trustee. If the trustee does not deem the information to be confidential, the information shall not be made public before Defendant has an opportunity to seek a protective order from the Court. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest these operations.
G. If the trustee has not accomplished the divestiture required by Section IV of this Final Judgment within six months after the appointment of the trustee becomes effective, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture, (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestiture has not been accomplished, and (3) the trustee's recommendations; provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such reports to Defendant and the United States, who shall each have the right to be heard and to make additional recommendations. The Court shall thereafter enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to accomplish the purposes of this Final Judgment, which shall, if necessary, include extending the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VII. NOTIFICATION
Within two business days following execution of a definitive agreement, contingent upon compliance with the terms of this Final Judgment, to effect, in whole or in part, any proposed divestiture pursuant to Sections IV or VI of this Final Judgment, Defendant or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture, shall notify Plaintiff of the proposed divestiture. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify Defendant. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed transaction and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered to, or expressed an interest in or a desire to, acquire any ownership interest in the assets that are the subject of the binding contract, together with full details of same. Within fifteen calendar days of receipt by Plaintiff of such notice, Plaintiff may request from Defendant, the proposed purchaser, any other third party, or the trustee, if applicable, additional information concerning the proposed divestiture and the proposed purchaser. Defendant and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree. Within thirty calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty calendar days after Plaintiff has been provided the additional information requested from Defendant, the proposed purchaser, any third party, and the trustee, if there is one, whichever is later, the United States shall provide written notice to Defendant and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States provides written notice to Defendant and the trustee that it does not object, then the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to Defendant's limited right to object to the sale under Section VI(C) of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed purchaser or upon objection by the United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or Section VI shall not be consummated. Upon objection by Defendant under the proviso in Section VI(C), a divestiture proposed under Section VI shall not be consummated. Provided, however, a proposed divestiture pursuant to the Auction Procedures approved by the United States under Section IV(D)(3) of this Final Judgment shall be deemed acceptable to the United States under this section.
VIII. AFFIDAVITS

Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts that Defendant has taken to solicit a buyer for the Divestiture Assets and to provide required information to prospective purchasers, including the limitations, if any, on such information.
B. For Divestiture Assets being sold using the California Auction Procedures, during such Auction Procedures, submission of bids to the United States in compliance with Section IV shall satisfy compliance with the required contents of the affidavits in Section VIII(A).

Case No. 1:05-cv-431
Hon. Sandra S. Beckwith, C.J.
Hon. Timothy S. Hogan, M.J.


United States' Memorandum in Opposition to American Association
of Orthopaedic Surgeons' [AAOS] Motion for Leave to File Reply
Plaintiff United States of America submits this response to the ""Motion For Leave to File American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons Reply To Plaintiff United States' Response To Public Comments,"" (Dkt. Entry # 94) (""Proposed Reply""). The AAOS filed its motion and proposed reply one week after the Court, on February 28, 2008, entered the Final Judgment. The AAOS's motion and proposed reply amounts to asking this Court to set aside the Final Judgment that it has recently entered. In particular, the AAOS asks the Court to (1) obtain additional input from third parties, (2) order the United States to further respond to its comment, and (3) hold a hearing on the ""issuance of compliance"" with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 16 (""APPA""). Proposed Reply 4-5.
The AAOS's pleadings assert no valid factual or legal bases for the Court to grant the requested relief. The AAOS's arguments amount to a repetition of the same points that it raised in its comment (Dkt. Entry # 81-2) during the now-completed APPA public comment period. The AAOS reiterates its contention that this case ""is the result of the antitrust laws not being applied equally to the insurance industry as they are to physicians or other professions"" and that the Court should consider this purported inequality in the APPA proceeding. Proposed Rely at 2. The United States explained in its Response to Public Comments (""Response to Comments"") (Dkt. Entry ## 90, 91 ยง XI) that the AAOS's argument is outside the scope of the APPA proceeding because the APPA does not permit the Court to review the merits of the United States' decision not to pursue a claim against an entity. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d 1448, 1459 (D.C. Cir. 1995); United States v. SBC Communications, Inc., 489 F. Supp.2d 11-15 (D.D.C. 2007); United States v. The Thomson Corp, 949 F. Supp. 907, 913 (D.D.C. 1996).
The United States and the Court have fully complied with the APPA, including the notice and comment provisions. Accordingly, the Court should deny the AAOS's motion.
Discussion
The Court Should Reject the AAOS's Request that the Court Obtain Additional Input from Third-Parties, or Order the United States to Further Respond to Comments.
The Court should not obtain additional third-party input, or order the United States to further respond to comments. The United States has complied with the APPA, which prescribes a sixty-day period for the public to submit comments on the proposed Final Judgment following publication of notices and certain documents. 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 16(b)-(c). Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. ยง 16(b), the United States had the proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement (""CIS"") published in the Federal Register, along with the Complaint, on July 18, 2007, at 72 Fed. Reg. 39,450. Further, a summary of the terms of the proposed Final Judgment and CIS was published for seven consecutive days in the Cincinnati Enquirer from July 20 through July 26, 2007, and in the Washington Post from July 18 through July 24, 2007, also pursuant to the APPA. The sixty-day comment period commenced on July 27, 2007, and ended on September 24, 2007.
The United States received five comments on the proposed Final Judgment, (Dkt. Entries # 86-1, 2, 3, 4, 5), and on December 17, 2007, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. ยง 16(d), the United States filed its Response to Comments. On January 24, 2008, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. ยง 16(d), the United States had its Response to Comments published in the Federal Register at 73 Fed. Reg. 4,268, and the Court entered the Final Judgment on February 28, 2008. That the AAOS disagrees with the United States' and the Court's evaluation of its position does not warrant conducting what would amount to a second comment period and a second review of the Final Judgment, outside of the APPA's prescribed framework.
The Court Should Reject the AAOS's Request that It Hold a Hearing.
The Court should reject the AAOS's request that the Court hold a hearing. Again, the Court should not re-open this proceeding because the United States and the Court have fully complied with the APPA, the Court has entered the Final Judgment, and the AAOS has raised no new issues of fact or law. Moreover, in its 2004 amendments, Congress made clear that ""[n]othing in this section shall be construed to require the court to conduct an evidentiary hearing or to require the court to permit anyone to intervene."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 16(e)(2). The procedure for the public interest determination is left to the discretion of the court, with the recognition that the court's ""scope of review remains sharply proscribed by precedent and the nature of Tunney Act proceedings."" SBC, 489 F. Supp. 2d at 11. Here, the Court has already concluded that its review of the record was sufficient to determine that the Final Judgment is in the public interest.
The 2004 Amendments to the APPA Do Not Provide Any Bases For the Court to Set Aside the Final Judgment.
The only legal and factual assertions that the AAOS makes in its pleadings are that the United States' Response to Comments is ""incorrect"" because (1) the ""Response ignores that the APPA was amended in 2004 to expand the Court's authority in approving proposed judgments,"" and (2) the AAOS's comment ""directly related to the underlying litigation."" Proposed Reply 2-4. The AAOS supports both points by referring to Congress's addition of language to the APPA in 2004 that requires courts to consider ""the impact of entry of such judgment upon competition in the relevant market or markets,""15 U.S.C. ยง 16(e)(1)(b). Proposed Reply 2-3. According to the AAOS, the 2004 amendments ""ostensibly . . . overrule[d]"" the standards and the cases on which the United States relied in its Response to Comments, including Microsoft, supra, and The Thompson Corp., supra. Proposed Reply 3-4.
The AAOS's arguments conflict with the holding of the only case on which the AAOS relies, SBC, supra. In SBC, the court held that ""a close reading of the law demonstrates that the 2004 amendments effected minimal changes, and that this Court's scope of review remains sharply proscribed by precedent and the nature of [APPA] proceedings."" Id. at 11. The SBC court rejected the same argument that the AAOS makes here: that the 2004 amendments' requirement that courts consider the judgment's impact ""upon competition in the relevant market or markets"" allows the court to look beyond the complaint's allegations. Id. at 14-15.
Instead the SBC court held that ""a district court is not permitted to 'reach beyond the complaint to evaluate claims that the government did not make and to inquire as to why they were not made.' "" Id. at 14 (quoting Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1459) (emphasis in original). The court's holding relied upon, and quoted from, the Microsoft opinion that the AAOS incorrectly maintains the 2004 amendments overruled. The court continued that because ""review [under the 2004 amendments] is focused on the 'judgment', it again appears that the Court cannot go beyond the scope of the complaint."" Id.
The United States alleged in the complaint that the defendants coordinated a price-fixing conspiracy among Cincinnati-area obstetrician-gynecologists (""OB-GYNs""). Accordingly, contrary to the AAOS's claim, the 2004 amendments to the APPA, as interpreted and applied by the SBC court, require the court to evaluate the effect of the ""judgment upon competition"" among providers of OB-GYN services. 15 U.S.C. ยง 16(e)(1)(b). Because the United States did not allege that health insurers had violated the antitrust laws, it is not appropriate for the court to seek to determine whether insurers have in fact engaged in anticompetitive conduct and the potential effects of such conduct.
In short, the AAOS's motion and proposed reply are repetitions of its previous comment that cite no new facts or law that warrant the Court to reconsider its decision that the Final Judgment is in the public interest.

U.S. District Court


MEMORANDUM
Before the Court for the public interest determination required by the Tunney Act is a proposed final judgment giving effect to the terms of an antitrust consent decree between and among the United States Government, Fiat S.p.A. (""Fiat""), Fiat Acquisition Corporation (""Fiat Acquisition""), New Holland, N.V. and New Holland North America, Inc. (""New Holland"") and Case Corporation (""Case""). It appears, upon examination in light of the violations charged in the complaint, that the terms of the decree are not ambiguous, that the proposed enforcement mechanism is adequate, that third parties will not be ""positively injured,"" and that the decree does not make a mockery of judicial power. The final judgment is accordingly approved.
Facts
Fiat and Case, two of only five manufacturers of four-wheel-drive (""4WD"") and large two-wheel-drive (""2WD"") tractors in the United States and Canada, entered into an agreement whereby Fiat and its subsidiaries would acquire Case. If the proposed acquisition were permitted, Fiat and one other competitor would control about 80 percent of the 4WD tractor market and about 90 percent of the large 2WD tractor market in the United States and Canada. In addition, the acquisition would eliminate head-to-head competition between Fiat and Case, and would increase the likelihood that the remaining dominant firms in these markets will tacitly collude in a non-competitive manner, in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18 (1994). Complaint at 2-3.
The consent decree proposed by the parties permits Fiat and its subsidiaries to acquire Case, but resolves the government's antitrust objections by, among other things, requiring the defendants to do the following: (1) sell New Holland's Genesis line of 2WD tractors; (2) sell New Holland's Versatile line of 4WD tractors and its line of tracked tractors that is currently in development; and (3) sell Case's ownership interest in Hay and Forage Industries, a joint venture that makes hay and forage equipment. The proposed final judgment requires that the purchaser of the divested assets continue to operate them in the manufacture and distribution of 4WD and large 2WD tractors and hay tools.
The consent decree further provides that defendants must accomplish the divestitures within 150 calender days after the filing of the complaint, or within five days after notice of entry of the consent decree, whichever is later, to purchasers acceptable to the government. If defendants do not do so within the time specified in the consent decree, a trustee appointed by the Court would be empowered for an additional six months to sell those assets.
The parties have scrupulously adhered to the ""sunshine"" requirements of the Tunney Act, codified as 15 U.S.C. ยง 16 (a)-(i) (1994) . The proposed final judgment was duly published in the Federal Register. See 64 Fed. Reg. 68377-87. The government received two written comments on the proposed settlement. These comments, along with the government's responses, were published in the Federal Register. See 65 Fed. Reg. 10,109-11.
Before the consent decree can be finalized by entry of a final judgment, however, the Tunney Act requires that it must be found to be in the public interest.
Analysis
The Tunney Act provides that, when making the required public interest determination, the court may consider:
(1) the competitive impact of such judgment, including termination of the alleged violations, provisions for enforcement and modification, duration or relief sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered, and any other considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment.
(2) the impact of entry of such judgment upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be derived from a determination of the issues at trial.
15 U.S.C. ยง 16 (e) (1)- (2) .
The requirement of a public interest determination was added to the Tunney Act in 1974 by amendments enacted in part to remedy the practice of ""judicial rubber stamping"" of proposals submitted by the Justice Department.1 Appellate decisions issued since 1974, however, have made it clear that the public interest inquiry authorized by the Tunney Act is so limited in scope as to be very nearly a ministerial task. ""Public interest"" is to be defined in accordance with antitrust laws. United States v. AT&T. 552 F. Supp. 131, 149 (D.D.C. 1982), aff'd sub nom. Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983). Settlements that fall ""within the reaches of the public interest"" should be approved. United States v. Western Electric Co., 900 F.2d 283, 309 (D.C. Cir. 1990)(emphasis in original)(citing and quoting United States v. Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir. 1981), in turn quoting United States v. Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. 713, 716 (D. Mass. 1975)). The court is not to review allegations and issues that were not contained in the government's complaint, United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d 1448, 1459 (D.C. Cir. 1995), or base its public interest determination on antitrust concerns in markets ether than those alleged in the government's complaint, United States v. BNS Inc., 858 F.2d 456, 462-63 (9th Cir. 1988).
The role that remains for a district court is to ""examine the decree in light of the violations charged in the complaint and . . . withhold approval only [a] if the terms appear ambiguous, [b] if the enforcement mechanism is inadequate, [c] if third parties will be positively injured, or [d] if the decree otherwise makes 'a mockery of judicial power.'"" Massachusetts School of Law at Andover. Inc. v. United States, 118 F.3d 776, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (quoting Microsoft at 1462)(emphasis added).
Clarity or ambiguity of the decree
The proposed final judgment sets forth specific and precise remedies for the antitrust concerns identified in the government's complaint. It requires the divestiture of Hay and Forage Assets, 2WD Assets and 4WD Assets. Final J. at 6. It specifies what must be divested, and when. The final judgment is not ambiguous.
Adequacy of the enforcement mechanism
The proposed final judgment ensures that the Court will have the jurisdiction and ""power to ensure that the parties comply in full with the principles' mandated by the decree . . . in their conduct after divestiture."" AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 214. Its compliance mechanisms are adequate.
Impact upon third parties
The complaint identifies consumers in the approximately $1.5 billion tractor markets and the approximately $250 million small square baler, large square baler and self-propelled widrower markets, as parties likely to suffer antitrust injury from the lessening of competition if these acquisition were allowed without conditions. Complaint at 2. By requiring divestiture to companies that will be viable competitors, the final judgment will ensure that such injury does not occur.
The government received two written comments on the proposed settlement: (1) from Mark Zeltwanger of Wyatt Farm Center, on December 27, 1999; and (2) from August P. Hau of Hau Nutrition Service, on November 30, 1999.
Mr. Zeltwanger expressed concern that the proposed final judgment will result in the elimination of the New Holland tractor lines as a competitive alternative in the marketplace. As the government points out in its response, however, the proposed final judgment requires that the New Holland tractor lines be sold to another company (or companies) with the capability and will to provide substantial competition in the tractor markets.
Mr. Hau expressed concern that Fiat's acquisition of Case will harm consumers of farm equipment. In its response, the government agrees with this concern, but maintains that the divestiture required by the proposed final judgment will adequately address Mr. Hau's competitive concerns.
In view of the government's responses, these comments do not alter the Court's belief that entry of the final judgment is in the public interest.
Reasonableness of proposed remedies
The proposed final judgment does not ""make a mockery of judicial power.""
The final judgment presented by the parties has been signed and accompanies this memorandum.

IV. Divestiture
A. Defendant First Data is ordered and directed, within one hundred fifty (150) calendar days after the Court's signing of the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order in this matter, or five (5) days after notice of the entry of this Final Judgment by the Court, whichever is later, to divest NYCE Holdings in a manner consistent with this Final Judgment to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States in its sole discretion, after consultation with plaintiff states. The United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with plaintiff states, may agree to one or more extensions of this time period, not to exceed in total ninety (90) calendar days, and shall notify the Court in each such circumstance. Defendant First Data agrees to use its best efforts to divest NYCE Holdings as expeditiously as possible.
B. In accomplishing the divestiture ordered by this Final Judgment, defendant First Data promptly shall make known, by usual and customary means, the availability of NYCE Holdings. Defendants shall inform any person making inquiry regarding a possible purchase of NYCE Holdings that it will be divested pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide that person with a copy of this Final Judgment. Defendant First Data shall offer to furnish to all prospective Acquirers, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all information and documents relating to NYCE customarily provided in a due diligence process except such information or documents subject to the attorney-client or work-product privilege. Defendant First Data shall make available such information to the United States and plaintiff states at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.
C. Defendant First Data shall provide prospective Acquirers of NYCE Holdings, the United States, and plaintiff states information relating to the personnel involved in the production, operation, research, development, and sales at NYCE to enable the Acquirer to make offers of employment. Defendants will not interfere with any negotiations by the Acquirer to employ any of NYCE's employees whose responsibilities includes the production, operation, development, or sale of the products and services of NYCE.
D. Defendant First Data shall permit prospective Acquirers of NYCE Holdings to have reasonable access to personnel and to make inspections of the physical facilities of NYCE; access to any and all environmental, zoning, and other permit documents and information; and access to any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information customarily provided as part of a due diligence process.

G. Defendant First Data shall warrant to the Acquirer of NYCE Holdings that there are no material defects in the environmental, zoning, or other permits pertaining to the operation of NYCE, and following the sale of NYCE Holdings, defendants shall not undertake, directly or indirectly, any challenges to the environmental, zoning, or other permits relating to the operation of NYCE.
H. Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, after consultation with plaintiff states, the divestiture pursuant to Section IV, or by trustee appointed pursuant to Section V, of this Final Judgment, shall include the entire NYCE Holdings as defined in Section II(G) and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with plaintiff states, that NYCE can and will be used by the Acquirer as part of a viable, ongoing business engaged in the provision of EFT network services, including PIN debit network services, and EFT processing services. Divestiture of NYCE Holdings may be made to an Acquirer, provided that it is demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of the United States, in its sole judgment, after consultation with plaintiff states, that the divested asset will remain viable and that the divestiture will remedy the competitive harm alleged in the Complaint. The divestiture, whether pursuant to Section IV o Section V of this Final Judgment,
Shall be made to an Acquirer that, in the United States' sole judgment, after consultation with plaintiff states, has the intent and capability (including the necessary managerial, operational, technical, and financial capability) to compete effectively in the provision of EFT network services, including PIN debit network services, and EFT processing services in the United States; and
Shall be accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its solediscretion, after consultation with plaintiff states, that none of the terms of any agreement between an Acquirer and defendants give defendants the ability unreasonably to raise NYCE's costs, to lower NYCE's efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of NYCE to compete effectively.
V. Appointment of Trustee to Effect Divestiture
A. If defendant First Data has not divested NYCE Holdings within the time period specified in Section IV(A), it shall notify the United States and plaintiff states of that fact in writing. Upon application of the United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with plaintiff states, the Court shall appoint a trustee selected by the United States, and approved by the Court to effect the divestiture of NYCE Holdings.
B. After the appointment of a trustee becomes effective, only the trustee shall have the right to sell NYCE Holdings. The trustee shall have the power and authority to accomplish the divestiture of NYCE Holdings to an Acquirer acceptable to the United States, in its sole judgment after consultation with plaintiff states, at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon reasonable effort by the trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections IV, V, and VI of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court deems appropriate. Subject to Section V(D) of this Final Judgment, the trustee may hire at the cost and expense of defendant First Data any investment bankers, attorneys, or other agents, who shall be solely accountable to the trustee, reasonably necessary in the trustee's judgment to assist in the divestiture.
C. Defendants shall not object to a sale by the trustee on any ground other than the trustee's malfeasance. Any such objections by defendants must be conveyed in writing to the United States, plaintiff states, and the trustee within ten (10) calendar days after the trustee has provided the notice required under Section VI.
D. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of defendant First Data, on such terms and conditions as the United States approves, and shall account for all monies derived from the sale of NYCE Holdings and all costs and expenses so incurred. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its services and those of any professionals and agents retained by the trustee, all remaining money shall be paid to defendant First Data and the trust shall then be terminated. The compensation of the trustee and any professionals and agents retained by the trustee shall be reasonable in light of the value of the asset to be divested and based on a fee arrangement providing the trustee with an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished, but timeliness is paramount.
E. Defendants shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture. The trustee and any consultants, accountants, attorneys, and other persons retained by the trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the business to be divested, and defendants shall develop financial and other information relevant to such business as the trustee may reasonably request, subject to customary confidentiality protection for trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or to impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture.
F. After its appointment, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the United States, plaintiff states, and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestiture ordered under this Final Judgment. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding month, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, NYCE Holdings and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest NYCE Holdings.
G. If the trustee has not accomplished such divestiture within six months after its appointment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture; (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why the required divestiture has not been accomplished; and (3) the trustee's recommendations. To the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the United States and plaintiff states, and the United States and plaintiff states shall have the right to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court thereafter shall enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate to carry out the purpose of the Final Judgment, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.
VI. Notice of Proposed Divestiture
A. Within two (2) business days following execution of a definitive divestiture agreement, defendant First Data or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture required herein, shall notify the United States and plaintiff states of any proposed divestiture required by Section IV or V of this Final Judgment. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed divestiture and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered or expressed an interest in or desire to acquire any ownership interest in NYCE Holdings, together with full details of the same.
B. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the United States and plaintiff states of such notice, the United States and plaintiff states may request from defendants, the proposed Acquirer, any other third party, or the trustee if applicable, additional information concerning the proposed divestiture, the proposed Acquirer, and any other potential Acquirer. Defendants and the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree.
C. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) calendar days after the United States and plaintiff states have been provided the additional information requested from defendants, the proposed Acquirer, any third party, and the trustee, whichever is later, the United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with plaintiff states, shall provide written notice to defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If the United States provides written notice that it does not object, the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to defendants' limited right to object to the sale under Section V(C) of this Final Judgment. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed Acquirer or upon objection by the United States, a divestiture proposed under Section IV or Section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by defendants under Section V(C), a divestiture proposed under Section V shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
VII. Financing
Defendants shall not finance all or any part of any purchase made pursuant to Section IV or V of this Final Judgment.
VIII. Hold Separate
Until the divestiture required by this Final Judgment has been accomplished, defendants shall take all steps necessary to comply with the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered by this Court. Defendants shall take no action that would jeopardize the divestiture ordered by this Court.
IX. Affidavits
A. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the Court's signing of the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order in this matter, and every thirty (30) calendar days thereafter until the divestiture has been completed under Section IV or V, defendants shall deliver to the United States and plaintiff states an affidavit as to the fact and manner of their compliance with Section IV or V of this Final Judgment. Each such affidavit shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding thirty days, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any interest in NYCE Holdings and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. Each such affidavit shall also include a description of the efforts defendants have taken to solicit buyers for the asset to be divested, and to provide required information to any prospective Acquirer, including the limitations, if any, on such information. Assuming the information set forth in the affidavit is true and complete, any objection by the United States, in its sole discretion, after consultation with plaintiff states, to information provided by defendants, including limitations on the information, shall be made within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of such affidavit.
B. Within twenty (20) calendar days of the Court's signing of the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order in this matter, defendants shall deliver to the United States and plaintiff states an affidavit that describes in reasonable detail all actions defendants have taken and all steps defendants have implemented on an ongoing basis to comply with Section VIII of this Final Judgment. Defendants shall deliver to the United States and plaintiff states an affidavit describing any changes to the efforts and actions outlined in defendants' earlier affidavits filed pursuant to this section within fifteen (15) calendar days after the change is implemented.
C. Defendants shall keep all records of all efforts made to preserve and divest NYCE Holdings until one year after such divestiture has been completed.
X. Compliance Inspection
A. For purposes of determining or securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or of determining whether the Final Judgment should be modified or vacated, and subject to any legally recognized privilege, from time to time duly authorized representatives of the United States, including consultants and other persons retained by the United States, shall, upon written request of a duly authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division,and on reasonable notice to defendants, be permitted:
access during defendants' office hours to inspect and copy, or at plaintiff's option, to require defendants to provide copies of, all books, ledgers, accounts, records and documents in the possession, custody, or control of defendants, relating to any matters contained in this Final Judgment; and
to interview, either informally or on the record, defendants' officers, employees, or agents, who may have their individual counsel present, regarding such matters. The interviews shall be subject to the reasonable convenience of the interviewee and without restraint or interference by defendants.
B. Upon the written request of a duly authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, defendants shall submit written reports, under oath if requested, relating to any of the matters contained in this Final Judgment as may be requested.
C. No information or documents obtained by the means provided in this section shall be divulged by the United States to any person other than an authorized representative of the executive branch of the United States, except in the course of legal proceedings to which the United States is a party (including grand jury proceedings), or for the purpose of securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or as otherwise required by law.
D. If at the time information or documents are furnished by defendants to the United States, defendants represent and identify in writing the material in any such information or documents to which a claim of protection may be asserted under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and defendants mark each pertinent page of such material, ""Subject to claim of protection under Rule 26(c)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,"" then the United States shall give defendants ten (10) calendar days notice prior to divulging such material in any legal proceeding (other than a grand jury proceeding).
XI. No Reacquisition
Defendants may not reacquire any ownership interest in NYCE during the term of this Final Judgment.
XII. Retention of Jurisdiction
This Court retains jurisdiction to enable any party to this Final Judgment to apply to this Court at any time for further orders and directions as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out or construe this Final Judgment, to modify any of its provisions, to enforce compliance, and to punish violations of its provisions.
XIII. Expiration of Final Judgment
Unless this Court grants an extension, this Final Judgment shall expire ten years from the date of its entry.

The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the parties, who shall each have the right to be heard and to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court shall enter thereafter such orders as it shall deem appropriate in order to carry out the purpose of the trust, which may, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment by a period requested by the United States.

This Final Judgment applies to Foster and Portec, as defined above, and all other persons in active concert or participation with any of them who receive actual notice of this Final Judgment by personal service or otherwise.
IV. DIVESTITURES
Defendants are ordered and directed, within ten (10) calendar days after the Court signs the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order in this matter, to divest the Divestiture Assets to the Acquirer in a manner consistent with this Final Judgment. 
Defendants will not interfere with any negotiations by the Acquirer to employ any current or former Portec employee who is responsible in any way for the design, development, production, marketing, servicing, distribution, and/or sale of any of the Divested Portec Product Lines.  Interference with respect to this paragraph includes, but is not limited to, enforcement of non-compete clauses and offers to increase salary or other benefits apart from those offered company-wide.  In addition, for each employee who elects employment by the Acquirer, Defendants shall vest all unvested pension and other equity rights of that employee and provide all benefits to which the employee would have been entitled if terminated without cause.
Defendants shall warrant to the Acquirer that each asset will be operational on the date of sale.
Defendants shall not take any action that will impede in any way the permitting, operation, use, or divestiture of the Divestiture Assets.
Defendants shall warrant to the Acquirer that there are no material defects in the environmental, zoning or other permits pertaining to the operation of each asset, and that following the sale of the Divestiture Assets, Defendants will not undertake, directly or indirectly, any challenges to the environmental, zoning, or other permits relating to the operation of the Divestiture Assets. 
Defendants shall be permitted to occupy, under sublease to the Acquirer or other arrangement, for a period of sixty (60) days from the date the Transaction is closed, that portion of the Huntington Facility that is not currently being used to manufacture any of the Divested Portec Product Lines. 
Defendants shall divest Portecโs entire business relating to each of the Divested Portec Product Lines and will not manufacture any products using any intangible assets divested pursuant to paragraph II(F)(3) of this Final Judgment. 
Defendants shall, as soon as possible, but within one business day after completion of the relevant event, notify the United States of:  (1) the effective date of the Transaction; and (2) the effective date of the sale of the Divestiture Assets to the Acquirer. 
Unless the United States otherwise consents in writing, the divestiture pursuant to Section IV of this Final Judgment, shall include the entire Divestiture Assets, and shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that the Divestiture Assets can and will be used by the Acquirer as part of a viable, ongoing business involved in the design, development, production, marketing, servicing, distribution, and sale of the Divested Portec Product Lines, that the Divestiture Assets will remain viable, and the divestiture of such assets will remedy the competitive harm alleged in the Complaint.  The divestitures shall be:
made to an Acquirer that, in the United Statesโs sole judgment, has the intent and capability (including the necessary managerial, operational, technical and financial capability) of competing effectively in the design, development, production, marketing, servicing, distribution, and sale of the Divested Portec Product Lines; and
accomplished so as to satisfy the United States, in its sole discretion, that none of the terms of any agreement between the Acquirer and Defendants give Defendants the ability unreasonably to raise the Acquirerโs costs, to lower the Acquirerโs efficiency, or otherwise to interfere in the ability of the Acquirer to compete effectively.
V. FINANCING
Defendants shall not finance all or any part of any purchase made pursuant to Section IV of this Final Judgment.
VI. HOLD SEPARATE
Until the divestiture required by this Final Judgment have been accomplished, Defendants shall take all steps necessary to comply with the Hold Separate Stipulation and Order entered by this Court.  Defendants shall take no action that would jeopardize the divestitures ordered by this Court.
VII. COMPLIANCE INSPECTION
For the purposes of determining or securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or of determining whether the Final Judgment should be modified or vacated, and subject to any legally recognized privilege, from time to time authorized representatives of the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division, including consultants and other persons retained by the United States, shall, upon written request of an authorized representative of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, and on reasonable notice to Defendants, be permitted:

to interview, either informally or on the record, Defendantsโ officers, employees, or agents, who may have their individual counsel present, regarding such matters.  The interviews shall be subject to the reasonable convenience of the interviewee and without restraint or interference by Defendants.

If, at the time information or documents are furnished by Defendants to the United States, Defendants represent and identify in writing the material in any such information or documents to which a claim of protection may be asserted under Rule 26(c)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Defendants mark each pertinent page of such material, โSubject to claim of protection under Rule 26(c)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,โ then the United States shall give Defendants ten (10) calendar days notice prior to divulging such material in any legal proceeding (other than a grand jury proceeding).
